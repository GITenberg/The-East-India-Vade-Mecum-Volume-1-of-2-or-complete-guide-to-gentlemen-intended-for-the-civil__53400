  <h2 class='c014'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c016'>In the volumes now offered to the public,
it has been my zealous endeavour to supply
those minutiæ and details, which have
not, in any distinct manner, been heretofore
tendered to its consideration. A
residence of more than twenty years in
Bengal, during which period I had every
opportunity of visiting the several districts
under that presidency, has enabled me to
afford considerable insight into a variety
of topics, which, whether to the statesman,
the merchant, the military, or the
civil character, should prove highly important,
and guide, not only to a just
conception of the characters of the natives,
and of the European society, in
India, but to the removal of that host of
doubts, prejudices, and national opinions,
which, if suffered to prevail, must occasion
every object to be seen through a false
medium.</p>

<p class='c008'>With the view to render my labors more
acceptable to my juvenile readers, whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>welfare is attended to in every page, it
appeared to me expedient to adopt rather
a familiar, than a didactic, style; so as to
lead towards the goal of instruction, in
that easy manner which is generally found
best suited to that intention. The same
principle induced me to avoid any arrangement
under abstract heads, or chapters;
as well as to render the contents at large
philosophically diffuse.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mode adopted in my former publication,
‘<span class='sc'>The Wild Sports of the
East</span>’, namely, of spelling the Hindostanee
words according to English pronunciation,
having been highly approved, is
continued on this occasion. This plan
appears particularly necessary in a work
intended chiefly for the use of persons
proceeding to India; since nothing could
be more unpleasant than a deficiency in
respect to intonation; which, being once
established in error, must prove extremely
difficult of correction.</p>

<p class='c008'>While studying to supply the several desiderata
left unnoticed by those gentlemen
who have written on subjects relating to
India, I felt it incumbent on me, both
from a sense of delicacy, and from the
conviction that they had already passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>through more able hands, to avoid whatever
topics had been abstractedly considered.
Therefore, such of my readers as
may seek for particular information regarding
the religious tenets of the several
sects, the languages of the East, the literature,
&amp;c., &amp;c., should consult those
eminent authors to whom the world is so
much indebted. The whole of their works
may be obtained by application to Messrs.
<span class='sc'>Black</span>, <span class='sc'>Parry</span>, and <span class='sc'>Kingsbury</span>, of
Leadenhall Street, London, from whose
ample catalogue I beg leave to cull the
following, as being particularly applicable
to the use of students laudably intent on
obtaining the most valuable sources of
oriental learning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The works of <span class='sc'>Doctor Gilchrist</span>
stand pre-eminent, and, while they do
honor to himself, are highly creditable to
the discrimination and liberality of the
<span class='sc'>East India Company</span>, under whom he
held a Professorship. In the purchase of
the few volumes necessary towards the
equipment of a gentleman proceeding to
India, the whole of Doctor Gilchrist’s
philological publications ought to be
included. <span class='sc'>Dr. Wilkin’s</span> edition of
<span class='sc'>Richardson’s Persian Dictionary</span> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>equally indispensable to writers, who may
be desirous to attain a proficiency in the
Persian language, by which they become
eligible for officers of the highest rank:
but, to cadets, who do not wish to go to
the expence of two volumes, quarto, the
<span class='sc'>Abridgement</span>, by <span class='sc'>Mr. Hopkins</span>, in one
volume, royal octavo, is particularly recommended.
<span class='sc'>Dr. Wilkins’s Sanskrita
Grammar</span> will also be found eminently
serviceable; while his translation of the
<span class='sc'>Heetopades</span> will afford much insight into
the narratory idiom of the Hindus. <span class='sc'>Richardson’s
Arabic Grammar</span>, as also <span class='sc'>Sir
W. Jones’s Persian Grammar</span>, or <span class='sc'>Gladwin’s
Persian Moonshee</span>, and his <span class='sc'>Gulistan
of Sady</span>, should not be omitted.
<span class='sc'>Sir Wm. Ouseley’s Essay towards facilitating the reading
of Persian Manuscripts</span>, will prove a substantial aid.
<span class='sc'>Balfour’s Forms of Herkern</span>, in Arabic
and English, should be provided; together
with <span class='sc'>Rousseau’s Dictionary of
Mahomedan Law Terms</span>. <span class='sc'>Mr. Colebrooke’s
Digest Of Hindu Law</span>, is indispensable;
and I strongly recommend his
<span class='sc'>Treatise on the Husbandry and Internal
Commerce of Bengal</span>. <span class='sc'>Sale’s
Koran</span> will supply the fullest information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>regarding the fundamental principles of the
Mahomedan religion; and <span class='sc'>Reynell’s
Memoirs</span>, united with his <span class='sc'>Atlas</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Map</span>, or <span class='sc'>Arrowsmith’s Map of India</span>,
on a larger scale, will prove the
best guides in acquiring the geography,
together with many local matters extremely
interesting to persons travelling
in any part of our territory, but especially
in Bengal. The <span class='sc'>Ayeen Akbekry</span> will
shew what Hindostan was under the government
of <span class='sc'>Akbar</span>; and the <span class='sc'>Asiatic
Researches</span>, and <span class='sc'>Asiatic Annual
Register</span>, will be found to display an
immense variety of subjects connected
with natural history, &amp;c. The Tour made,
under the auspices of Marquis Wellesley,
by <span class='sc'>Doctor Francis Buchanan</span>, through
the <span class='sc'>Mysore</span>, <span class='sc'>Canara</span>, and <span class='sc'>Malabar</span>
Districts, may be considered one of the
most valuable productions of the age;
inasmuch as it details, with philosophic
consideration, and, in most instances, with
alchemic precision, a variety of matters
relating to the climate, the soil, and those
various articles of produce, as well as the
mode of manufacture, which cannot fail
to prove highly interesting to those either
engaged in mercantile speculations, or who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>thirst after useful knowledge. This work
is published by Messrs. <span class='sc'>Black</span>, <span class='sc'>Parry</span>,
and <span class='sc'>Kingsbury</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to those regulations published
for the control, or guidance, of
persons proceeding to, or residing in,
India, fluctuations must at times take
place. <span class='sc'>Messrs. Black, Parry</span>, and
<span class='sc'>Kingsbury</span>, publish yearly a <span class='sc'>Directory</span>,
under the immediate authority of
the <span class='sc'>Court of Directors</span>, the latest
edition of which ought to be purchased in
the first instance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soliciting my readers’ indulgence regarding
any typographical errors, which
may, notwithstanding the greatest attention
in correcting for the press, occasionally
appear, and anxiously hoping that he
may at least be amused, if not instructed,
by the perusal of my pages, I consign
them to the consideration of a discriminating,
just, and liberal public; trusting
that my motives, at least, will be rewarded
by its approbation.</p>

<p class='c016'>The consideration, that great numbers of young
gentlemen proceed to India without the smallest
idea of the customs, &amp;c. peculiar to that country
whither they are adventuring; and, that the want
of some previous instruction has often proved of
the greatest inconvenience; first induced me to
assume the pen, for the purpose of submitting, to
those under such circumstances, the result of a
long residence in Bengal. When it is understood,
that, merely owing to the absence of any
experienced friend, or to the impossibility of
obtaining some publication suited to guide under
a case of no small difficulty, not only many a
guinea, which could perhaps be ill spared, is
thrown away, but many a lasting injury entailed,
little apology need be offered for that earnestness
with which I recommend my volumes to the
attention, not only of those who are about to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>proceed to the East, but of such as have relatives,
or friends, in that remote quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first point offering itself to notice, is,
whether an appointment is to be obtained in the
Company’s service, either in a civil, a military,
or a naval capacity; or, whether the party is
about to adventure as a merchant, or free-mariner.
If the Company’s service be in question,
it will be necessary to follow implicitly those
regulations the Court of Directors, from whom
alone any appointment can be obtained, have,
from time to time, judged it expedient to promulgate
for the better management of their affairs,
and for obviating misconception on the part
of every candidate, as well as to shield him from
imposition. As these regulations are subject to
much fluctuation, and as it would be burthening
this work too much were they to be embodied
therein, besides that it would be, to a certain degree,
infringing on the rights of others, to whose
assiduity the public are considerably indebted,
I have excluded them altogether; confining myself
to pointing out, that the ‘<span class='sc'>East India Directory</span>,’
published annually by Messrs. Black,
Parry, and Kingsbury, but edited by gentlemen
holding offices at the India-House, will be found
the best guide in all such matters, as it contains
the code in force at the time of publication.</p>

<p class='c008'>Formerly, a great number of persons received
commissions in the army, and in the medical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>departments in India, from the governor-general,
for which necessity was the plea; but that practice
was severely censured, and has been for full
twenty-six years completely exploded. The
hope of obtaining an appointment in India, as a
Company’s servant, should never be entertained;
none being bestowed but by the Court of Directors;
though, it is true, the recommendations of
their government abroad, in behalf of meritorious
individuals, have, in very numerous instances,
been attended to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little argument need be used to demonstrate
the superior policy, or rather the imperious necessity,
of sending young men from England in
such a state of improvement as may enable them
to become useful immediately on their arrival at
the presidencies to which they may be respectively
nominated. This is effected by the institution
of a college, and of a military academy,
under the auspices of the Court of Directors:
at the former, those intended for the civil service
are duly grounded in the languages, &amp;c. of the
East; while, at the latter, young gentlemen are
instructed in whatever may be essential towards
their military career. By these means, the natives
are induced to entertain more respect for
the junior servants, than could possibly be expected
while a want of every local requisite, and
even of the very rudiments of professional science,
were too conspicuously apparent. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>‘<span class='sc'>Directory</span>’, already spoken of, will be found to
contain whatever relates to the proper qualifications
of young men aiming at employ under the
Company; but I may be permitted to state, that
whenever any undue influence may be exerted,
by pecuniary means, to obtain any appointment,
in whatever branch, expulsion and disgrace, or
eventually, fine, &amp;c. will be the result.</p>

<p class='c008'>The opportunity which offers for the selection
of civil servants duly qualified to fill offices of
considerable importance, to which either large
salaries, or handsome fees, &amp;c. are attached, affords
the ready means of rewarding the labors of
meritorious individuals in that branch; and, with
few exceptions, of enabling them, after a fair
term of servitude, to return to Europe with competent
fortunes. Hence, the Company have not
found it necessary to stipulate for their granting
any pensions to civil servants; but, whenever the
pressure of infirmity, or of misfortune, has exhibited
to the Court of Directors an object justly
entitled to their consideration, such civil servants,
and, on many occasions, their widows and
children also, have experienced that attention to
their distresses which might elevate them beyond
the reach of adversity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the military branch, where a marked level
prescribes the rise of every individual, beyond
which, except in a few instances of staff-appointments,
the utmost merit may unhappily remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>unrewarded; and where, in so destructive a
climate, the discharge even of ordinary duties is
frequently attended with most injurious results
to the constitution; it has been adjudged necessary
to make some provision for those who
may either be compelled to seek the re-establishment
of health in their native country, under the
indulgence of a furlough, or who, having passed
the prime of their days in that quarter, may
choose to withdraw from the effective strength
of the army, passing their latter years in retirement,
and making way for the more active, to
supply their places in the performance of the
more arduous duties.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consideration of the important services rendered
to the Company by their military and naval
officers and surgeons, as also by their chaplains,
the Company have established certain rates of
income, under the general terms of full-pay,
half-pay, and pension, for such of them as may
retire from their service: those rates, together
with all the regulations in force, will be found
in the ‘<span class='sc'>East India Directory</span>’, before referred
to.</p>

<p class='c008'>No British subject, not born in India, can claim
the right of residing within the Company’s jurisdiction;
which extends from the Cape of Good
Hope, easterly, towards Cape Horn; including
all the Indian Seas, and the great Peninsula of
Asia, so far as the British flag is displayed, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>the exception, however, of the Island of Ceylon,
on which the whole establishment appertains
to the Crown, though generally some of the
Madras troops, or even a portion of the Bengal
army, may be seen doing duty there, as
auxiliaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Necessity has imposed very arbitrary rules on
the conduct of government abroad; none but
persons whose political conduct and opinions are
decidedly unexceptionable being permitted to
reside within the Company’s territories. Every
European inhabitant is registered, and furnished
with a licence, renewable at times, or subject to
be cancelled by the Supreme Council. Such is
the determination supported against whatever
may tend, however obliquely, towards colonization,
that, in Calcutta, though purchases may be
made of landed property, secured by <em>pottahs</em>,
that correspond generally with our title-deeds,
yet there does not appear to be any actual claim
to the soil. This does not create any diffidence
on the part of the purchaser, who, provided there
be no latent mortgage, &amp;c. always holds the property
as a fee-simple. This rule does not, indeed,
properly extend beyond the Maharrattah Ditch,
which formerly circumscribed the town on the
land side, making nearly a semi-circle, whose radius
might be more than a mile and a half: beyond
that ancient barrier; which in old times was found
a considerable protection against the incursions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>of the Maharrattah horse: though pottahs may
perhaps exist, their validity would not bear the
test of litigation. The Company, it is true, have
in various instances made grants of lands, but
always under such terms as precluded any claim
to property in the soil, as a permanent, independent,
and paramount tenure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The free-merchant, or, (as some designate
him,) the free-mariner, who may proceed to
India with the view of purchasing landed property,
or of becoming a renter in his own
name, will find himself in a very awkward, or
even a very hazardous, situation, should he
lay out his money in supposed purchases, or in
buildings, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>et cetera</em></span>, beyond the ascertained limits
of the town of Calcutta. My readers will therefore
correct, in due time, any erroneous impressions
arising from misrepresentation, or from misconception:
they must, in fact, alienate their
British opinions, and conform to local considerations;
divesting themselves of every prepossession,
and viewing our Indian possessions, not
as colonies, but as conquests, of a peculiar description,
to which our laws and privileges are
every way either unsuitable, or unwelcome.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall now proceed to the display of some
minutiæ regarding the out-fit of a gentleman
about to embark in a chartered ship; observing,
that no passenger can be received on board without
an express order in writing, directed to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>captain, and signed by the secretary. Should
an impostor succeed, of which, I believe, no instance
has ever come to light, in obtaining a
passage to India, by means of fictitious documents,
he would indisputably be detected on
arrival there, and be subjected to all the rigors
of the law. The several commanders of the
Company’s ships are so bound by agreement, as
well as by regulations, not to receive unauthorized
passengers, as to leave no opening for malpractices
of the above description.</p>

<p class='c008'>The out-fit of a military passenger will necessarily
differ, in a few points, from that of a person
proceeding in a civil capacity: whichever
may be the case, it will be found least expensive
to lay in the whole of the supplies of clothing,
so far as may be practicable, from the stock on
hand; obtaining any additional articles from
those tradesmen by whom the family may have
been usually furnished. I cannot too forcibly
deprecate the common practice of burthening
young folks with a variety of useless apparel,
&amp;c.; the greater part of which becomes the perquisite
of servants, or, being found rather a
burthen than a convenience, is generally thrown
about in the most negligent manner. The grand
object should be to provide what may be efficient
after arrival in India.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first point for consideration is the quantity
and the quality of the shirts, of which not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>less than four dozen should be provided. They
ought to be of very fine, stout calico, such as
may be used in a hot climate, where linen is
particularly prejudicial to health, owing to its
feeling cold when moist with perspiration. About
a dozen of the shirts may be of rather a superior
quality, and have frills.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under-shirts, made of chequered calico, of a
moderate fineness, will be found extremely pleasant,
and preserve the upper-shirts from being
soiled by contact with the body: of such, an
equal number should be made; if with sleeves,
and reaching to the hips, they will serve for
sleeping in: there should be no ties, nor any
opening, except for about eight inches down, on
one side, from the neck, but not in front; a button
will suffice to keep the parts together, after the
head has been passed through.</p>

<p class='c008'>For wear on board-ship, nothing can equal
pantaloons, of which two pairs of thick, and two
of thin, should be provided; together with as
many pairs of wove cotton long-drawers, to wear
under them. The thick kinds may be milled
broad cloth, or wove worsted; the thin ones of
light corderoy, aleppine, &amp;c. Half-stockings
of worsted, and of cotton, will be requisite; a
dozen pairs of the former, and three dozen of the
latter: they will all be found useful in India.
Two or three black velvet stocks, made to tie
with ribbon, will be serviceable; and, as articles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in great request abroad, about four dozen of
neck-handkerchiefs, of very fine linen, not calico,
should be made up: an equal quantity of a
coarser kind may be laid in for under wear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cotton handkerchiefs, of a small size, such as
may be put into a waistcoat pocket, will be
found preferable: of these, full four dozen; they
should be white, with very neat, narrow borders.
Two good warm waistcoats of woollen
must be provided, and about two dozen of white
waistcoats, made of fine Irish linen. Breeches
in the same proportion, and of the same qualities.
To wear with the latter, two dozen pairs
of long cotton stockings, and half a dozen pairs
of short, wove, cotton drawers, should be provided.
The stockings ought to be of the best
quality. A dozen pairs of silk stockings will also
be useful on arrival in India, where they are extremely
scarce, generally damaged, and bear an
enormous price.</p>

<p class='c008'>A substantial great-coat will, on many occasions,
be acceptable during the voyage; as will
two pairs of boots, and as many of shoes; one
stout, the other light, for ship wear.</p>

<p class='c008'>I cannot too forcibly recommend that measures
be left with the tailor, the shoe and boot-maker,
the hatter, &amp;c. in order that regular
supplies may be sent yearly, or half-yearly,
through the medium of some friend in London;
who could get all articles of such a description
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>shipped in the privileges of some of the officers
of the Indiamen; the freight payable on delivery
at Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay, respectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be proper to have two or three coats to
wear on board-ship: two should be of broad
cloth, and one of camlet, or some other light
stuff: a warm dressing gown of flannel, with
two lighter, of printed linen, will be essentially
serviceable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hats are so very subject to be injured on
board-ship, and, indeed, to be blown overboard,
that I should recommend but little attention to
appearance in that article. In this, as well as in
most of the foregoing, a large portion may be
supplied from the stock in use previous to embarkation.
The old saying, of ‘going to sea to
wear out one’s old clothes,’ has so far sense on
its side, that whatever can be decently worn will
be found full good enough for that purpose. Persons
who are growing, should observe the precaution
of having every article of apparel made
full large; else, by the time they may have been
some months at sea, they will be put to serious
inconvenience. It is true, that few ships sail
without a tailor on board, but he is not always
to be had; being generally employed by the
purser; or he may be in the sick list, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to leather-breeches, two pairs
may be taken by those accustomed to hard riding;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>though nankeen are in general use for the
greater part of the year. In the cold season, the
former are extremely comfortable. Three, or
even four, pairs of boots, as many of shoes, and
two round hats, of the best quality; together
with two best coats, of the lightest cloth, or
kerseymere, two waistcoats, and two pair of
breeches, of fine white kerseymere, should be
packed, with the intention of being reserved for
use in India.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be said, that tailors, shoe-makers, &amp;c.
abound in India; and, that every article above-mentioned
may be made up, or be obtained
there. The truth is, that all artizans in that
quarter expect exorbitant profits, to enable their
amassing sums wherewith to return to Europe.
The materials are likewise much dearer; and
many, if not all, of a very inferior quality. Articles
of European manufacture, except when
the market is absolutely glutted, bear full £80.
and occasionally £200. per cent. advance on the
prime cost: add to this, that sometimes gentlemen
are so far removed from their trades-people,
who are by no means expeditious in their work,
and, if at all expert, have ever more on hand
than they can execute, as to render it next to impracticable
for them to be supplied as they would
wish.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to woollens, boots, shoes, &amp;c.
Europe is the great source; no cloths being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>manufactured in India, except a kind somewhat
resembling serge; and the leather in general use
among the native cordwainers being so ill tanned,
that, after being once wet through, which is
effected by the slightest exposure to moisture,
it stretches, losing its shape and pliancy, so as
to be both uncomfortable and unsightly. The
native shoe-makers are certainly very neat in
their work, but, owing to the badness of their
materials, cannot, in this case, be recommended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blankets of a good quality are scarce, and
bear an unconscionable price. I should recommend
to every passenger, that he take three of
the largest double milled, and one smaller under
blanket. He will find them useful on board-ship;
and, in the cold season, will not be displeased
to find such in his possession. Their
value in the hottest time of the year, when the
wind is dry, and clouds of dust every where
passing, is extreme. If a bed be covered with
two or three blankets, at that season, it will
always remain cool and pleasant.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be supposed that calico sheets are not
adapted to the torrid zone; and such is strictly
the case. Accordingly, we find the greater portion
of Europeans provided with hemp sheeting:
many go to the expence of coarse Irish linen for
that purpose, and make their pillow cases of fine
Holland, or of a fabric, called <em>grass-cloth</em>, imported
from China, and said to be made from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>the
smaller fibres of what is usually called <em>India-gut</em>,
or <em>weed</em>. Whatever the material may be,
its smooth, glossy surface, and its disposition to
resist absorption, more than any other cloth in
use, qualify it pre-eminently for that purpose to
which we apply it.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should recommend that twelve sheets were
taken; each formed of one breadth of very fine
Russia, or other hempen cloth, and full eleven
feet in length. During the passage, they may be
used in that form; which, if they are full ell-wide,
will be found broad enough. On arrival
in India they should be joined two and two, so
as to form three, instead of six pairs. In regard
to pillow cases, one for every pair of sheets in
their original state, will suffice: they should be
of Irish linen.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good mattress made of horse-hair, is, in the
East, a valuable article. I should recommend
one made to fit the cot, or bed-place, on board-ship;
which will generally be from 6 ft. to 6 ft.
2 in. in length, and from 22 to 28 in. in width.
This mattress should be filled to the thickness
of near five inches, and enclosed in a double case
of the strongest ticking: by this means, on arrival,
the mattress may be extended to double
its size, with the choicest materials; the hair
being spread thinner, and the ticking reduced
from double to single.</p>

<p class='c008'>A pillow filled with feathers is scarcely to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>seen in India! I would, however, recommend,
that, in lieu of a bolster, a pillow stuffed with
horsehair should be taken, with one feather pillow.
On board-ship, the former would be found
acceptable in hot weather, while the latter may
be resorted to in stormy latitudes. Their alternate
application, as uppermost, would prove
refreshing and comfortable, at least, if not conducive
to salubrity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Table cloths can be had better, and cheaper,
in India than in Europe; as can towels, or napkins,
also: it will, however, be necessary to take
about three or four dozen of rather large towels,
of a thick strong texture. Combs of sorts, tooth,
nail, clothes, and shoe brushes, with their respective
et ceteras, should not be forgotten. Soap,
for washing hands and for shaving, must be taken;
and if about twenty or thirty pounds of the patent
soap, which will wash with salt water, be
laid in, it may be useful in case a few articles
should, from necessity, be washed on board, and
will, at all events, be an invaluable present to any
persons who may do little jobs, such as making
the bed, cleaning boots, &amp;c.: to all such, soap
and pig-tail tobacco are more acceptable than
either money or liquor.—Cut tobacco is not
considered so valuable; smoking being next to
prohibited in every ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>A wash-hand bason, ewer, and chamber utensil,
will be required: these, at least the first and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>last, should be of pewter: the ewer should be
in the form of a bottle, both on account of the
convenience it offers in handling it, and because
water is less liable to be spilled from its mouth;
a common quart bottle is no bad substitute.
About a pound of good tea, and five or six
pounds of double-refined sugar, may be provided:
in case of indisposition they may be resorted to,
without troubling the captain’s servants beyond
the requisition of some hot water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons fond of shooting, would do well to
take with them one or more good double-barrelled
guns, with spare locks, a good supply of
flints, and all the necessary implements for cleaning,
&amp;c. in a very solid wainscot case, firmly
clamped with brass at the corners, lid, and bottom.
Shot is to be had in Calcutta, as is gun-powder,
of the first quality. A good pointer
dog will be found highly valuable; preferable to
a bitch, which rarely lives in that climate after
her first, or, at most, her second litter; besides,
it is common for the captain and officers to expect
whatever pups are born on board: on the
other hand, a male pointer, of established breed
and reputation, must be eagerly sought by all
sportsmen, who will cheerfully give a portion of
its progeny to the owner.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to military persons, whose apparel
and accoutrements cannot be ascertained
previous to quitting England, they should confine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>their attention to laying in those materials which
cannot fail of becoming useful on their arrival:
thus, an officer of infantry ought to purchase a few
yards of the best <em>super-superfine</em> scarlet broad cloth,
or kerseymere, for making up his regimentals;
an officer of artillery or of engineers, blue, &amp;c.
The whole establishment not being exactly uniform
in particular points, such as the colors of
the facings, the patterns of the swords, &amp;c. nothing
can be done, with propriety, in those instances:
this, however, is the less important,
because every cadet is, on arriving in the country,
sent to join a corps composed of gentlemen
under similar circumstances, about sixteen miles
from Calcutta, in which he must serve for two
years, or until judged qualified to do duty with
the regiment to which he may stand appointed
as an ensign.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every thing in the cutlery line should be taken
from England; the most essential are as follow.
Two good razors, in a case, with a small
strop, a small looking glass, two or three pairs of
scissors, of sorts; two or three good penknives,
a riding knife, with fleam and picker, a pair of
good carvers, a dozen of table knives and forks,
ditto of dessert, all plain bone or ivory handles;
a pocket case of apparatus for scaling the teeth;
mathematical instruments may be included
under this article, as may black-lead pencils of
the first quality, with colors, hair pencils, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>drawing and writing papers; all of which are
extremely dear in India, and, according to the
usual modes of shipping, rarely arrive in good
condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good gold watch, with light chain and seals,
together with some spare glasses fitted, will be
indispensable. A small telescope, that may be
easily carried in the pocket, will prove amusing
on many occasions, and, to a military man, must
ever be ranked among absolute necessaries. In
regard to plate, very little is wanted for a single
gentleman. Six table spoons, twelve tea spoons,
a soup spoon, a marrow spoon, and four salt
spoons, will be found as much as usually can be
required; as will be better understood when I
come to describe the manner of living among
Europeans.</p>

<p class='c008'>The very limited space allowed for the baggage
of each passenger, renders it indispensably
necessary that every article should be packed
close. Many consider a large sea-chest to be
useful; but, in my opinion, it is the worst receptacle
that could be devised; especially as it
becomes useless on arrival in India. I should
strongly recommend four boxes, well covered
with leather, and clamped with brass, measuring
about 26 or 28 inches in length, 18 in breadth,
and 18 in depth. Each should have within a
lifter, so that half its contents may be taken out
at pleasure, the lower tier remaining undisturbed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>The contents of each part to be noted on a piece
of stiff paper, which should be pasted within
the lid: a copy to be written in a memorandum
book, so that the contents of the several boxes
(which should be numbered and lettered with
the proprietor’s initials, thus, <span class="multiline"><span class='xsmall'>A.B.<br />—<br />1</span></span> <span class="multiline"><span class='xsmall'>A.B.<br />—<br />2</span></span> <span class="multiline"><span class='xsmall'>A.B.<br />—<br />3</span></span> <span class="multiline"><span class='xsmall'>A.B.<br />—<br />4</span></span>)
may be known without opening them. Only one
of these need ever be in use at a time; the rest
being sent down into the after-hold; which usually
is opened once or twice weekly, on stated
days, for the convenience of those who may wish
to have access to their packages.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have derived very considerable convenience
from sorting all my linen into sets: for instance,
a shirt, an undershirt, (commonly called a
<em>banian</em>,) a pair of stockings, two neck handkerchiefs,
and a pocket ditto: these I rolled up as
tight as could be effected by manual force, and
surrounded with a towel, which, being pinned,
kept all fast and clean. In this form my linen
could be packed in a very small space. Foul
linen should always be put up in the same manner.
One box, containing articles in reserve,
should be exempted from such as might be occasionally
wanted: it should be allotted to hats,
silk stockings, best coats, linen, waistcoats, &amp;c.
Each will occupy about five cubic feet; therefore,
the whole may be comprised in half a ton
measurement.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should observe, that blankets, &amp;c. not in use,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>may be put under the mattress; and, that, if a
standing bed-place is in question, about four
yards of coarse woollen, such as serge, perpet,
shalloon, or baize, may be taken on board, wherewith
to make a set of curtains; which, in some
situations, such as the steerage, will be found
not only comfortable, but absolutely necessary.
Those who have been on board any coasting vessel,
fitted up for the accommodation of passengers,
will instantly accord with this piece of advice,
and comprehend how desirable it is that
every box, &amp;c. beyond that in immediate use,
should be consigned to the after-hold. If more
than four trunks should be deemed necessary,
they may generally be had ready made at most of
the manufacturers. The size described ought
not to be exceeded, on account of the facility
with which such may be suspended in slings made
of canvas, and be carried on bullocks, one trunk
on each side. Too much cannot be said on this
point; since the degree of compactness an officer
is able to attain, will generally determine
the quantity he may be able to carry, and insure
its early, as well as its safe, arrival.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are not in the Company’s service,
are left to make the best bargain they can with
the commanders of the Indiamen, and to select
such ships for their conveyance as may best suit
their views in regard to destination and time
of sailing. The Company, some years ago, issued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>their orders, that only certain stated sums
were to be taken by the commanders of ships in
their employ, according to the rank of passengers
respectively.—A reference to the <span class='sc'>Directory</span>
will shew what were prescribed, any trespass on
which was declared tantamount to an <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ipso facto</em></span>
dismissal from the service. The regulations formerly
included only as far as majors, under the
supposition that all above that rank would indulge
in the hire of cabins; for which they must,
of course, pay extra. The specified sums were
what the Company paid on all occasions where
the passage-money was receivable from their
own treasury.</p>

<p class='c008'>However just and benevolent the intention of
the Company evidently was; since it served to
protect their servants from impositions which
had, on many occasions, been ruinous to individuals
in low circumstances, and, in some instances,
caused them to apply to the Court of
Directors for loans, to enable their returning to
India; still, it cannot be denied, that the stipulated
rates are by no means adequate compensation
for the very heavy expence a commander
incurs, when laying in stock for a voyage generally
estimated at six months duration. Whatever
may be paid by individuals of the several
classes respectively, each invariably expects to
be received with the same cordiality, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>partake, without distinction, of whatever the
stores may afford.</p>

<p class='c008'>It needs no argument to prove, that a ship
containing a great number of cadets, under the
limited rates, would by no means be a gaining
concern to the commander. Hence, the outward
voyage is not the object of a commander,
who, even under the most favorable circumstances,
could not make any great profit by his
passengers; but, by his liberal treatment of them,
he obtains that character which insures him a
choice of rich persons returning to Europe, who,
in the aggregate, rarely fail to make up to him
for his former trouble, and deficiency of pecuniary
benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual to enquire among the commanders
as to their probable number of passengers, and
to ascertain the dates at which their ships are,
according to the arrangements made at the India
House, to be despatched. The pursers are commonly
employed to adjust the rates of passage,
and to dispose of such cabins as may be intended
for the accommodation of passengers. Matters
being settled, it is necessary to apply to the secretary
for an order to be received on board the
vessel in question; which order is delivered to
the commander, or to his purser, so soon as obtained.
The secretary likewise furnishes every
Company’s servant with a certificate of his appointment;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>and to each free-mariner, &amp;c. he
gives a licence to proceed to India. These papers
must be carefully preserved, for delivery into
the office of the secretary under that presidency
to which the party may be destined. It is always
best to consign them to the keeping of the purser.
In cases of certificates having been lost,
much difficulty has arisen, and all the parties
have been obliged to depose to that effect on
oath.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should advise those who are about to embark,
to cultivate an acquaintance with the respective
commanders. Experience fully establishes,
that civility rarely fails to produce good consequences.
It is reasonable to conclude, that some
previous acquaintance must engender some good
will. The captains navigating under the auspices
of the India Company, are men who have
seen much of the world, and who rarely fail
justly to appreciate those marks of attention, and
respect, which flow voluntarily from persons with
whom they have dealings. On the other hand,
it must be rather uncomfortable to go on board
a ship where all are total strangers; or, at the
best, where, perhaps, the purser alone, and that
with some hesitation and difficulty, acknowledges
ever to have seen your face! Common sense
points out that such is both impolitic, and uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having made a voyage in a foreign ship from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Bengal to the Cape, it may be serviceable to some
of my readers to receive a hint or two regarding
the usage he is likely to experience, should he
entertain a disposition to avail himself of that
channel of conveyance. The detail need not be
prolix; for it may justly be asserted, in few
words, that foreign vessels are rarely sea-worthy;
they are badly equipped, and worse manned;
their decks are low; their accommodations dark,
dismal, and offensive; their water execrable;
their provisions scarce and bad; their commanders
ignorant, avaricious, mean, proud, tyrannical,
and deceitful! That some exceptions may exist,
cannot be denied; but I never heard of one who
did not, more or less, merit the above stigma.</p>

<p class='c008'>Look to the Company’s ships, and see the reverse!
The truth is, that in them we find most
of those good points that are established in the
Royal navy, added to much desire in their commanders
to be on a friendly footing with the passengers;
while, I believe, there is no doubt that,
in the end, their terms are more moderate than
those of any foreigners.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the circumstances of a passenger should enable
him to hire a cabin, his comfort will be increased
inconceivably, even though he should
have barely room enough to swing a cot, or to
put up a standing bed. But, that he may not
deceive himself in respect to the accommodation
he is to derive from such a retirement, it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>be proper for him to pay a visit to the vessel
while lying in the river, probably at Gravesend,
or the Hope, and there to ascertain the exact
dimensions he is to occupy. It is an object, if
he uses a swinging cot, that the breadth of the
cabin should be such as to allow of its being
triced up between the beams during the daytime;
thereby to have it out of the way, and to
give more space in the cabin. When suspended,
it should be lengthwise; so that, as the ship rolls,
or lays down on either side, the cot should swing
even. When hung athwart-ships, unless the cabin
be very broad, it would be perpetually knocking
against the bulk-head (or partition), and the
ship’s side. Hence it is advisable, wherever the
space may admit, to make a standing bed-place
fore and aft, furnishing it with rails, to keep the
occupant from rolling out; for, if it be made
athwart-ships, and the vessel be working against
an adverse wind, he must, whenever the ship
goes about, change the position of his pillow,
from head to foot alternately.</p>

<p class='c008'>In peaceable times, cabins are ordinarily constructed
of wooden partitions, and have a door,
with lock, &amp;c. very complete; but, during war
time, it is usual to make them of canvass, fixed
to the beams above, and rolling up thereto, whenever
the vessel may be cleared for action. Some
cabins include a port-hole, which, in large ships,
is peculiarly comfortable; especially under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Line, when a current of air is invaluable; but, in
bad weather, when the port is shut, those cabins
that have only skuttles, about one-fourth the size
of a port-hole, become preferable; especially
when they are provided with glass shutters;
which can be at any time made by the ship’s
carpenter, if not previously attached. The skuttles
being higher up in the side of the vessel,
and nearer to the deck above the cabin, are well
calculated for allowing rarefied air, which would
float above the level of a port-hole, to escape.
They are usually placed at intervals between the
ports. When a cabin is built so as to include a
port, the gun appertaining thereto is commonly
sent forward, and lashed up to the ship’s side,
the muzzle pointing forward; but, on emergency,
the cabin is knocked down, and the gun is run
into its place. Hence, each kind of cabin has
its advantages, and disadvantages.</p>

<p class='c008'>The right side of the ship, from stem to stern
is called the <em>starboard</em>; the left side is called the
<em>larboard</em>: the line on which the mast stands, <i>i.e.</i>
straight over the keel, divides them. The starboard,
in most modes of applying the term, implies
superiority over the larboard. Thus the
chief mate has his cabin, which is usually
12 or 14 feet long, by 10 or 12 in breadth, next
to the great cabin, on the starboard side of the
gun-deck. The second mate has one rather
smaller, on the opposite, or larboard side. Then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>again, the third mate on the starboard side, immediately
before the chief mate’s; next before
him the fourth mate; while the surgeon and
purser usually have their cabins on the larboard
side, next before the second mate’s.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is called the ‘great-cabin,’ is a slip taken
off across the stern of a ship, on the gun-deck,
about 14 feet deep, leaving a passage on the larboard
side that the passengers and officers may
have access to the quarter-gallery, or privy, on
that quarter. The great-cabin includes all the
stern windows, therefore, is extremely light and
airy; but, on the other hand, its situation is rather
disadvantageous to those who are troubled
with habitual sea-sickness. The bows and the
stern partake, in an accumulated ratio, of the
ship’s motion, as she pitches; that is, as she rises
and sinks, alternately, at the head and stern;
consequently, the centre of every vessel is the
part least subject to agitation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The captain occupies, in general, a cabin called
the ‘state-room,’ situated under the fore part of
the poop, on the starboard side, with a glass
door towards the quarter-deck: its dimensions,
as well of those of all the cabins already described,
vary according to the ship’s tonnage, but
may be taken at about 15 or 16 feet square: the
space including it, and the larboard side under
the same parallel, is called the ‘cuddy;’ while
all behind is designated the ‘round-house;’ and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>has a row of glass windows in the stern part,
with two doors opening into the ‘stern-gallery:’
a flight of steps, rather confined to be sure, serves
as a communication, by means of the starboard
quarter-gallery, with the great-cabin. These
steps, under which is a privy, are particularly
convenient to ladies, who usually have the starboard
side of the great-cabin allotted to their
accommodation. When the passengers are very
numerous, especially when many families are on
board, the round-house is partitioned off into
three or more cabins; the larboard quarter-gallery,
on the upper deck, having also a privy. In
such case, the dinner table is laid in the cuddy,
instead of the round-house; but, as it is rarely
spacious enough to allow the whole to sit down
at the same time, the company are, commonly,
divided into two parties, succeeding each other
every day alternately.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sums paid for cabins entirely depend upon
the demand, their size, the ship’s destination,
and the circumstances of the person selling his
accommodations. The several portions of the
round-house and great-cabin, both of which
are considered the captain’s property, of course
are paid for in proportion to their respective dimensions:
it may, however, be taken as some
guide, that, outward bound, a slip, including one
window, may produce from £200. to £300.; and
that the several mates’ cabins may be averaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>at from £3. to £5. for every square foot of the
enclosed area. Homeward bound, on account
of the number of children and servants shipped
with a family, the rates are yet higher: I have
known, more than once, the whole of a great
cabin let for £2,500.!</p>

<p class='c008'>There being an essential difference in the comfort
afforded by having either a cot or a fixed
bed-place, it may be acceptable to my readers to
be informed of some minutiæ attached to those
conveniences respectively. A cot is an oblong
case of canvas, having a deal frame at the bottom,
with a canvas sacking well strained; the
ends are furnished with small cords, called nettles,
which pass round an iron thimble, or <em>grummet</em>;
and those again are passed over two strong
hooks, placed about seven feet asunder, fore and
aft, whereby the cot is suspended. During the
day time, a cot is commonly taken down, and
disposed of in some part where it may, so far as
the means allow, be out of the way: the best
mode is to trice it up between the beams that
support the superior deck. In this kind of bed,
the motion of the ship is scarcely felt, unless
she is acted upon by a very short, broken
sea; the cot always preserving its level: hence,
those who are much troubled with sea-sickness
should always provide a swinging cot; taking
care to hang it in such a place as may preclude
the danger of its being bumped against the ship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>sides, or the bulk-head, (<em>i.e.</em> a boarded partition,)
than which nothing can be more unpleasant. I
have several times been canted completely out
of my cot, owing to the want of space at its
sides. In very bad weather, when the ship has
rolled many streaks of her deck under water, the
frame of my cot has been forcibly dashed against
the beams: at such times, if the width of the
space admits, it is proper to lengthen the nettles
to their utmost: whereby such inconvenience
may generally be obviated.</p>

<p class='c008'>A standing bed-place is so far convenient, that
the necessity for removing in the morning, and
affixing at night, is done away; whereby the
bed-furniture is greatly preserved from filth and
injury: besides, its occupant can ‘turn in’
whenever he pleases, and has the satisfaction of
knowing that his trunk is, by being under him,
secured from damage, as well as from depredation;
whereas persons who sleep in cots often
experience considerable inconvenience in those
particulars. Those who have fixed bed-places
in the larboard division of the great-cabin, are
by far more privately, and more comfortably, situated
than such as have them in the steerage,
ranging along the bulk-head of the chief mate’s
cabin: in either case, there are always two tiers,
or ranges, of bed-places, one above the other;
the lower are certainly most convenient.</p>

<p class='c008'>As priority of embarkation, or at least of adjustment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>gives a right to selection, it is advisable
to visit the ship so soon as an order for being
taken on board is obtained; when a choice should
be made as to the situation of a bed-place; those
of the lower tier, nearest the stern windows in
the great cabin, are to be preferred, they being
both more airy, and more light: the latter will be
found an object to those who are studious, or
partial to reading in bed, which, on board-ship,
is held to be a most delectable recreation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In adjusting with the captain, or his purser,
it is proper to be very exact in stipulating for a
berth in the great-cabin; and it would be as well
to notice the conveniences to be afforded, in the
body of the receipt given for the passage-money.
Not that I would lead to the supposition of deceptions
being practised intentionally; but, in
the hurry of business of considerable importance,
such lesser items will occasionally slip the memory,
giving birth to disagreements which not
only are attended with future distrust, but may,
perhaps, be beyond the possibility of remedy. It
should, however, be considered that a bed-place
in the great-cabin, which generally is fitted up
for eight, or, at the utmost, for twelve, will be
charged somewhat higher than one in the steerage;
the latter being an open passage, totally
devoid of privacy, exposed to violent currents of
air, not always of the sweetest, and subject to
many obvious inconveniences.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Among the ship’s company, two or three
men, or boys, are usually excused the general
duty of the ship, for the purpose of attending
the passengers: when other matters are settling
on board, care should be taken to engage
one of these attendants to do all the work in the
cabin, if one is hired; namely, to clean boots
and shoes, brush clothes, clean the basons, provide
hot and cold water, attend to the boxes in
the hold; with a variety of et ceteras which will
soon obtrude into notice. For such good offices,
about three or four guineas will be expected;
but it must not be supposed that, for such a
compensation, a man will devote his whole time
to one passenger; nor, indeed, is it necessary
that he should, since an active, intelligent fellow,
who has been used to such menial offices, may,
with great ease, give satisfaction to at least four
or five. When such an aid cannot be obtained,
on account of the scarcity of hands on board, a
douceur to any of the mates’ servants will answer
every purpose, besides probably giving the advantage
of being served by one perfectly conversant
with ship affairs, and possessing some influence
with the captain’s steward; with whom I
humbly recommend to all passengers that they
keep on good terms; he being no small man in
his way, and having the power to afford many
conveniences, which, though in the estimation
of folks on shore apparently insignificant, are,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>nevertheless, of considerable value to those unaccustomed
to a sea-life, and cooped up for
months within such narrow limits!</p>

<p class='c008'>This reflection leads me naturally to the consideration
of that line of conduct which should,
on all occasions, be maintained by those who
wish to pass their time as agreeably as circumstances
will admit, and to appear respectable.
In the first place, the captain will exact from
every one on board, of whatever class, a perfect
attention to the regulations of his ship: were
he to allow any deviation, the whole would be
aiming at the same indulgence, and subordination
would be annihilated! It is customary,
whenever a person ascends from the gun-deck
to the quarter-deck, or goes upon it from the
cuddy, &amp;c. to touch his hat; even though no
one should appear there: a breach of this rule
would be considered grossly insulting, and might
induce to rebuke, by no means pleasant to the
feelings, or adding to the credit, of a gentleman.
When it is considered with what a high hand
the officers of ships are obliged to uphold their
authority, over a numerous crew composed of
all nations, and often including the most hardened
and daring culprits, we cannot but applaud
every practice tending to preserve order, regularity,
and decorum.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hour for breakfast may be generally stated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>to be eight, for dinner two, for tea six, and for
supper nine. The first is announced by the
great bell on the fore-castle, which always rings
a sonorous peal when the watch, or guard, is to
be relieved: tea-time is known by the same signal.
As the dinner hour does not correspond
with the relief of the watch, it is usual to warn
the passengers and officers by beat of drum:
the tune of ‘Roast-beef’ being daily heard,
though it rarely leads to a participation of that
viand whence its designation is derived. Very
little notice is required to call together those
who are disposed to partake of supper: for the
most part, the company amuse themselves with
cards, music, &amp;c. during the evenings; or,
when the weather admits, walk the quarter-deck;
observing to keep on the windward side;
which is held to be the privilege only of the
captain, the three senior mates, the purser, the
surgeon, and those passengers who board at the
captain’s table.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although nothing very sumptuous is to be
expected on board-ship, yet there will be little
or no cause to complain of deficiency. The
breakfast ordinarily consists of good tea and
coffee, with excellent biscuit, and, at times,
rolls; which, as well as every species of leavened
bread, come under the marine designation of
‘soft-tommy.’ The butter, to be sure, is not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>be boasted of; it being utterly impossible to
prevent its melting, so as to resemble liquid
honey.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being studied to take on board as much
fresh meat as possible, at the time of sailing,
some joints of good beef and mutton may be
served up for the first week; after which the
‘corned’ (or slightly salted) meat comes into
use. The ample supply of poultry, of all descriptions,
fed in coops on the poop, and a
small flock of sheep, perhaps from twenty-five
to forty in number, maintained there on hay,
&amp;c. enable the captain, for the most part, to
exhibit fresh meat, of some sort, every day;
which added to abundance of prime beef and
pork for his use, together with tongues,
pickles, sauces of all kinds, potatoes, rice,
pastry, olives, &amp;c. &amp;c. form a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tout ensemble</em></span>,
where even the most dainty may find something
acceptable to the palate.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be supposed, that wine is so freely
dispensed, as when on shore; the ladies, however,
are generally supplied with as much as
they may require during the repast; after the
cloth is removed, the bottle is put round two
or three times, according to the liberality of
the commander. The last tour it makes being
accompanied with ‘good afternoon’ serves
as a hint for the gentlemen to withdraw, until
the hour for tea; when, as already observed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>they frequently amuse themselves until supper
is ready.</p>

<p class='c008'>This last meal is little more than a matter of
form; it consists chiefly of cheese and biscuits,
rasped beef, sago-soup, lobs kous, which is a
curious medley of various ingredients, forming
something midway between water-gruel and
peas-soup. One tour of the bottle, attended
with ‘good night,’ closes the operations of the
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The water taken on board being strongly impregnated
with filth, of various kinds and
colors, soon becomes so nauseous as to be
utterly unfit for the use of delicate persons:
the quantity of animalculæ it contains could
not be credited by a person who had not seen it!
On this account, several filtering-stones are
used, through which the water finds a passage,
leaving the impurities behind. This percolation
is, however, extremely tedious, and does
not entirely remove the taint; though it assuredly
so far sweetens it as to render the water
very drinkable. The fecula left in the hollow
of the drip-stone, are perfectly putrid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ordinary beverage is table beer, or perhaps
porter: in warm weather excellent spruce
beer abounds; sometimes, indeed, the whole
crew are supplied with from one to two quarts
daily. Nor is the punch-bowl suspended for
empty shew! By means of prepared lemon-juice,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>aided by a good stock of the fresh fruit,
carefully suspended in nets in the stern-gallery,
&amp;c. good punch, lemonade, and negus, are often
served to the company.</p>

<p class='c008'>I strongly recommend, that all young persons
should be embarked at Gravesend, or the Nore;
in preference to being taken on Board at Portsmouth;
by that means they become settled before
the generality of passengers arrive, and
escape that indescribable confusion attendant
upon the sudden influx of whole hoys full of
dead and live lumber! For such they appear
when interrupting the several operations attendant
upon a vessel’s getting under weigh. Those
who purpose delaying to the last moment,
should leave their cards of address with the
purser, taking care not to be far from home,
that he may, when proceeding to the India-House
to receive the packets, send notice of his
being about to quit town. On receipt of such
notice, no time must be lost in repairing to that
port where the vessel may be; in being customary
to sail so soon as the purser gets on board.
Half an hour’s delay has proved the loss of many
a passage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great number of ships employed in the
India trade, occasions so frequent an intercourse,
that scarcely two months ever elapse
without one or more being despatched to some
part of India. Unless under very peculiar and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>pressing circumstances, it is inadvisable to proceed
in any not bound to that part whither the
passenger is destined: for, although it appears,
on paper, very easy to get from Madras, for
instance, to Bengal, such will not always be
practicable; and so great a delay may elapse as
should allow a vessel bound to Bengal, sailing
perhaps a month or two subsequent to that proceeding
to Madras, to arrive at her port before
the means might offer of getting on from Madras.
Add to this, that freight and passage-money are
infinitely higher in India than in Europe; which,
combined with the heavy expence attendant
upon long detention on shore, would prove the
economy, as well as the speed, to be on the
other side of the question.</p>

<p class='c008'>The time of sailing will, under common circumstances,
decide the time of arrival. Ships
leaving England, that is, the Land’s End, in all
April, may be expected to arrive at Madras in
all September; when, if not delayed, they may
run up the Bay in a week more, with great ease.
As the northerly monsoon often begins to prevail
in October, occasioning ships to stretch
over towards Acheen-head, whereby from four to
six weeks will be lost in getting to Balasore
Roads, it is rather advisable not to sail later
than March, if at liberty to choose the season.
By so doing, the arrival will take place at a time
when the great heats are over, and the cold weather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>is approaching: two points not only eligible
as they relate to health, but to society also.
The early, or late, arrivals of such writers and
cadets, as are appointed for the same year, make
no difference whatever in the rank they are relatively
to bear; that being determined by a general
list transmitted by the Directors, generally in
the last ship of that season. The pay, however,
is calculated from the date of presenting the certificate,
before spoken of, at the proper office.</p>

<p class='c008'>The period of sailing will generally indicate
the weather which may be expected during the
whole passage. Such as leave the pilot in the
spring will round the Cape of Good Hope about
Whitsuntide or Midsummer, when winter prevails
in that Quarter; it being in 34° south latitude:
advancing to the northward, they will
meet with the trade-winds from the tropic towards
the Line, where, in all probability, light
and variable winds may cause some delay. Ships
leaving England in our autumn, round the Cape
at their Midsummer, and reach Madras generally
in from eighteen to twenty weeks; carrying
fair, but warm, weather all the way. If
they arrive about the middle, or latter end of
March, they may, by remaining for a few days,
until the southerly monsoon is fairly established,
sometimes reach the sand-heads in Balasore
Roads in three or four days. This is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>obviously preferable to running over to the eastward.</p>

<p class='c008'>I know nothing more unpleasant than being
wind-bound! Nor, indeed, can there be well
conceived a more certain recipe for draining the
purse! The passenger must not suppose that,
after having repaired to that port where the ship
rides, he is at liberty to go on board instantly,
and to remain until she sails. On the contrary,
though he should not fail to intimate his arrival,
and to leave his card of address, he must put up
at some inn, or lodging-house, at his own expence,
until the signal may be made for sailing,
by firing a gun, and loosening the fore top-sail,
by that ship under whose convoy a fleet
is to sail; or, if there be no convoy, by the
senior captain; who is, by courtesy, designated
‘Commodore.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The Court of Directors have, latterly, in consideration
of the inability of their junior servants to
pay the heavy charges to which they are subject
while in port, given an extra sum to the commanders
of their ships for each cadet’s diet in
such situations. This was no less necessary
than considerate. It will have been seen, that
persons going out in the civil service have fewer
stipulations in their favor; for which the presumptive
reason is, that they are commonly the
sons of gentlemen possessing large property: the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>sum of £3000. having been so often given for
writer-ships, seems to indicate that very little
occasion could exist for interference in their
behalf.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship arrives at any regular port,
where accommodations can be had, the passengers
are, in like manner, expected to reside on
shore, at their own charge. Such, to many,
may appear unreasonable, or strange; but, when
it is considered to what heavy losses a commander
might else be subject, which, divided
among a number, would appear trifling, and, at
all events, not prove ruinous, the propriety of
such a rule will not be disputed. This explanation
may serve as a hint to parents, and guardians,
not to ship young folks <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>in forma pauperis</em></span>, under
the prudent, but here inapplicable, precaution,
of taking away the means of being extravagant.
Emergencies often arise, wherein a few guineas
are indispensably necessary; and, as few go to
sea with more cash than ordinary expences may
demand, it is not easy to remedy the error.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where a young man has established his character
for imprudence, the only recourse is to place
a few guineas, say from twenty to thirty, in the
hands of the captain, or the purser, with directions
to supply what may be absolutely required,
rather in form of a loan; keeping the youth in
ignorance of his having a banker on board, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>giving him, at taking leave, perhaps five or six
guineas, in order to carry on the deception.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it is known that no shop of any kind exists
in a ship, (excepting the purser’s slop-shop,)
we must conclude there can be little opportunity
for extravagance: the principal danger is to
be apprehended from gaming, which in some
ships reaches to a dreadful extent; always creating
difficulty, and rarely terminating without
bloodshed. This, added to emulation for the
favorable opinion of the ladies, may be considered
the usual causes of discord. The latter is, in a
great measure, restrained by that custom which
fixes every passenger to the same seat at table
during the whole voyage; whereby daily contests
for vicinity are avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of accidents that have happened from
trivial causes, renders it necessary to be
extremely cautious in regard to smoking; which
in all men of war, and India-ships, is permitted
only on the fore-castle. By this means danger
is avoided, and the stench carried away. It
is to be lamented that so proper a regulation
is not observed throughout the merchant service;
in which so much carelessness prevails,
that it appears to me miraculous so many vessels
arrive in safety. On my return from India,
I embarked at St. Helena on board a
whaler, of which the captain had a strong predilection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>for his pipe, which was scarcely ever
out of his mouth. His practice was, to smoke
in the cabin where we dined, throwing his hot
ashes down upon the deck, in which was a skuttle,
or small hatchway, under his own seat. Two
lieutenants of the navy, who were fellow-passengers,
used to remonstrate very freely, but
without the smallest effect, against so improper
a practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>It happened, one morning, as we were off the
Azores, that a suspicious-looking vessel hove in
sight, laying-to under close reefed top-sails: we
altered our course, and were immediately chased.
Having at least forty-five young fellows, and
about a dozen six-pounders, on board, we cleared
ship for action. Imagine what was our surprise
at finding that, under the identical hatchway,
over which our captain had been perpetually
smoking, was a magazine of about thirty
barrels of gun-powder; some hooped in, and
some having their chimes barely covering their
contents which proved to be ready-filled cartridges!
I conceive it would have been utterly
impossible, if the vessel in chace had proved
an enemy, and that we had been compelled
to defend our ship, to have avoided being blown
up!</p>

<p class='c008'>Many are in the habit of reading by candle
light in their beds: this only requires to be
known to the officers, to be completely overruled;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>nor will they, unless in cases of indisposition,
allow a candle to be burning after the
passengers have generally retired to rest. Hence,
only a few wax tapers, or bougies, can be requisite.
When it is considered, that a ship is
composed of materials for the chief part highly
combustible, and, that in such a situation a fire
spreads with astonishing rapidity, defying the
exertions of all on board; also, that there is little
chance of many lives being saved, unless other
vessels may be in company; we ought assuredly
to adopt every means of guarding against so terrible
a calamity!</p>

<p class='c008'>Most ships have a small fire-engine on board,
which is not only an admirable safe-guard, but
facilitates the washing of decks; an operation
that usually takes place once or twice weekly.
At such times all the chests are sent below, and
all the hammocks hauled upon deck, for the purpose
of being aired. Seamen become habitually
cleanly in their persons, and in their bedding;
but when recruits are on board, they, being less
attentive to personal appearance and to comfort,
not only breed vermin, but sometimes propagate
infectious diseases. Hence, a small quantity of
vermin-ointment will perhaps prove an useful
succedaneum; its timous application preventing
the growth of any colony, of which some
stragglers may have laid the foundation.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the decks are washed, it is customary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to exercise the seamen in the use of great guns.
For this purpose the drum beats to quarters;
when all repair to their several stations, and,
under the instruction of the several officers, go
through the ordinary operations attendant upon
that branch of discipline. No persons, of whatever
description, females excepted, are exempted
from being appointed to some post, where
their services may be efficient. The military
officers are allotted to commands on the poop,
fore-castle, waist, &amp;c.; having under them such
cadets and recruits as may be on board; the
whole acting as marines. The surgeon, with his
mates, those of the sick who are incapable of
taking an active part, together with all females,
descend to the cock-pit; which, being below
the level of the water-line, is tolerably secure
from danger; though sometimes a shot, between
wind and water, will find its way to that retreat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The crew are always portioned into two
watches, except when very numerous; in which
case, as well as during the time a vessel is in
port, they divide them, including recruits, &amp;c.
into three watches. The chief mate commands
the starboard-watch; the second mate
commands the larboard-watch; and, when there
are three, the other, called the mid-watch,
is commanded by the third mate. It is customary
to relieve the watch every four hours, except
in the interval between four and eight o’clock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>in the evening, which is divided into two reliefs,
of two hours each, called ’dog-watches.’ But
for the intervention of these, there would be no
change in the times of coming upon duty; as
each of the starboard and larboard watches
would, respectively, come on at the same hours
daily; and this would be the same, even if a
mid-watch existed: whereas, by dividing the
evening-watch, it occasions an odd number, and
changes the tour, or series, every day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where supplies of provisions are not attainable,
it necessarily follows that each person on
board can receive only a stipulated allowance of
meat, water, &amp;c. This does not always affect
those who are at the captain’s table; though it
is generally recommended to the passengers to
be economical in their expenditure of water for
washing, shaving, &amp;c. In some ships they are
restricted to a quart daily, and if the crew are
upon short allowance, which is understood to be
the case when each man receives less than two
quarts, the passengers and officers have little or
no fresh water allowed for the above purposes;
but their beverage at table is rarely limited, except
under the pressure of actual necessity.</p>

<p class='c008'>All things considered, the privations experienced
by passengers to India are by no means so
numerous, nor so severe in their operation, as
might at first view be apprehended. In many
ships, ladies and gentlemen skilled in music are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>adventitiously assembled, and, by their united
talents, afford a most pleasing recreation to all
on board: few vessels are totally destitute of
some means to attract the parties towards the
quarter-deck; where, in the cool of the evening,
during fair weather, the merry dance for a
while banishes <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ennui</em></span>, and contributes to give a
wholesome impetus to the circulation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those ladies who are partial to music should
be particularly careful that the piano-fortes
they may take with them, be constructed in
such manner as may exempt them from those
wondrous effects produced by the climate of
India. I have had the pleasure of aiding several
friends in this instance, and found that the instruments
made for exportation could never be
depended upon, unless clamped at every joint
with plates of brass, and secured, in the more
delicate parts, by means of battens well screwed
and cemented to the sounding board. Experience
has fully satisfied me, that the pianos most
appropriate for hot climates are made by Clementi,
Kirkman, and Tomkinson, at their respective
manufactories in London.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ladies will derive considerable convenience
and gratification from having an exterior case
made to enclose the piano-forte, leaving a space
of about an inch all around. This outward safe-guard
should be of planed deal, stained of a mahogany
color, or painted; and it should open in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>front, so as to admit of playing the instrument,
while its lid should be fixed upon hinges, that it
may be thrown back at pleasure. The lower
part of the frame may be packed, and laid by;
a spare frame of deal being substituted during
the voyage, with a set of shelves below to contain
music, books, &amp;c.; all locked up by means
of folding doors. Both the exterior case, and
the frame, ought to be furnished with lacquered
iron handles, whereby to lift them occasionally;
but particularly intended to secure them to the
side of the ship, and to the deck: without such
a precaution the whole would be tumbled about,
and shivered to atoms, by the vessel’s motion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gentlemen who perform on stringed instruments,
should be careful to provide an ample
supply of strings, firsts and fourths especially;
they being not only very dear, and perhaps damaged,
when procurable, but at times not procurable,
in any part of India, for love or money!
Reeds for oboes, clarionets, bassoons, &amp;c. are
similarly circumstanced. Nor would it be superfluous
for a lady to take with her several sets
of wires for her piano; they being very scarce.
At all events, she ought to qualify herself to
tune the instrument; which may be effected in
the course of a month, or six weeks, by attention
to the instructions of a regular tuner, who
would feel himself well satisfied under a moderate
compensation. This is a point whereon I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>dwell rather particularly; knowing that, even in
Calcutta, Madras, or Bombay, a good tuner is
not always to be had; and that, in all other
situations, throughout the interior scarce a professional
person can be found. Besides, in a
country whose climate deranges the most skilful
adjustment of the wires, often in a few minutes,
merely by a slight exposure to heat, or to damp,
the expence attendant upon such frequent
tunings, as are indispensably requisite, would
speedily absorb the full value of the instrument
itself; the ordinary rates being a guinea
for a grand-piano, and twelve shillings for a
square one. Therefore, whether considered as
a convenience, or as a matter of economy, too
much cannot be said in recommendation of every
lady’s learning to tune her piano before she embarks.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being impossible to say how soon rough
weather may be experienced after leaving port,
(indeed, sometimes ships get under weigh while
it is blowing very fresh,) it is usual to lash the
dinner tables to the deck, placing their feet in
mortices cut into small blocks, called cleats,
which, being firmly nailed down, generally keep
the whole sufficiently firm. It is not easy to
render the chairs equally secure; but they are
tolerably steadied by nailing two rows of battens
on each side of the table, so as to embrace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>the legs of the chairs, which, in this mode of
securing them, ought all to be of equal compass
from front to rear. It requires, after all,
some management to preserve an equilibrium
when a ship rolls much; which it does chiefly
in a calm, or in a gale of wind. In the former
instance, the transitions of reclination from starboard
to larboard, and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vice versâ</em></span>, are often very
great, owing to the heavy swell which alternately
raises the ship, and again sinks her into the
trough made by two successive waves. However
curious it may seem to persons unacquainted
with sea affairs, it is nevertheless certain,
that more masts are lost by rolling in a
calm, than by stress of weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to that most distressing malady, sea-sickness,
it is not possible to lay down any specific
mode of precaution, or of remedy: it ordinarily
commences with that agitation occasioned
in the vessel’s motion, by either the wind’s force,
or the water’s undulation. Few experience more
than a few qualms, while the water is smooth;
such as is the case in going through the Needles
with a leading wind, in fine weather; but when
upon a wind, with a chopping sea, and sudden,
or forcible, gusts, all who are not accustomed
to the motion, become most oppressively sick.
However much they may be affected by this customary
derangement, those suffering under its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>influence are more frequently objects of derisive
merriment, than of compassion. The prevalent
opinion is, that, in a few days, the complaint
will disappear; hence it is regarded as a matter
of course, and as a seasoning, which, by its mode
of operation, rather conduces to health, than to
a dangerous issue. That such is the usual result,
cannot be denied; but there are some constitutions
which cannot stand so forcible an attack:
women, in general, are most severely oppressed
by it, and some few fall victims thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be endless to enumerate all the recipes,
which those who fancy themselves qualified
to prescribe, tender on this occasion to the unhappy
sufferers. I believe that acids and laudanum,
in repeated small doses, are most successfully
administered; though I have seen them
fail. That unfeeling advice given to the unwary,
‘to drink a glass of spirits,’ invariably tends to
aggravate all the symptoms, and, with those
not habituated to such strong remedies, produces
all those inconveniences attendant upon
super-added irritation. The fresh air upon deck
will be found considerably to diminish the force
of the complaint; but the eyes should be
kept shut, and the attention be withdrawn
from the sea, and from the rigging; of both
which the motion is peculiarly calculated to
increase that swimming in the head inseparably
attendant on sea-sickness. If, notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>these precautions, the nausea and derangement
should continue, it will be proper to retire to
bed; observing the precaution of lying on one
side, and keeping the eyes closed.</p>

<p class='c008'>There may, perhaps, be no harm in taking a
small case of spirits on board; but such is by
no means indispensable: they do not come
within the scope of a gentleman’s expenditure;
and, unless preserved with uncommon vigilance,
will probably be drawn off by some adventuring
fellow, provided with a pick-lock, while the
owner is either asleep or absent. I cannot too
strongly inculcate, that every thing should be
under lock and key: ships, of every description,
are infested with petty pilferers, and sometimes
with more expert and daring thieves;
who will not fail to purloin whatever can be
turned to use, in such manner as may not lead
to discovery. The effects of passengers, especially,
are considered to be fair booty. Blankets,
sheets, &amp;c. will all disappear towards the close
of a voyage, or when in a port where they can
be sold, or bartered away, if their owners confide
too much in the honesty of their neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The third mate generally has a mess, in the
expences of which the fourth, fifth, and sixth
mates sometimes partake; the purser and surgeon
being invariably at the captain’s table.
The captain’s clerk, who is usually a midshipman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the surgeon’s mate, when there is one,
and the second class of passengers, all mess with
the third mate, who is allowed a certain space
before the officers’ cabins; which, being enclosed
with canvas, makes a very tolerable
berth, wherein the table is laid. Those of the
mess who belong to the ship, subscribe to lay
in such articles of provision, chandlery, &amp;c. as
may suffice for their own consumption; the
sums paid by passengers, who associate with
them, being applied in due proportion towards
the maintenance of the latter; any balances
arising therein becoming the perquisite of the
third mate. I have heard, that, with the exception
of so large a proportion of live stock as is
destined for the captain’s table, the mate’s mess,
in some ships, claims the palm in many respects.
When so many passengers are ordered on board,
as to render it impracticable for the captain to
accommodate the whole at his table, the later
applicants are consigned to the mate’s mess during
meals; but are admitted, so far as convenience
can be extended, to a participation of the
amusements and society of the round-house.
On some occasions the mate’s mess has, from
the above cause, been able to boast of rather
eminent characters.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are fond of fishing, may sometimes
derive much amusement from the possession
of a stock of tackle suited to the occasion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>In warm weather, especially towards the Line,
when moderate weather and calms prevail, many
sharks may be taken. The hook for this purpose
ought to be about a foot long in the shank
(the other parts bearing a just proportion) which
should be firmly attached to a stout piece of
chain, from two to four feet in length, having at
its other extremity a loop and swivel, to which
the rope (such as is called inch and half rope,
and ought to be full a hundred yards long) is
tied; the bait, a piece of fat pork, of about
three or four pounds weight. The weight of
the chain and hook will suffice to sink the bait
to about thirty feet below the surface, where it
will soon be discerned by the sharks, which
generally keep under the vessel’s bottom, or
play around her at a considerable depth; though
they will occasionally range along the ship’s
side, or bask under the stern, so as to be easily
shot with a musquet ball, or struck with a harpoon.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even at the depth of fifty feet, the shark may
be distinguished as he approaches the bait, by a
luminous appearance, extending in an oval form,
in that direction in which he swims. He generally
seizes with avidity, turning on his side at
the moment; without which he could not get
it into his mouth, owing to the excessive length
of his upper jaw. So soon as the bait is in his
mouth, the fish, on feeling the resistance of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>rope, makes a sudden plunge downward, at the
same moment recovering his former position. The
hook, being extremely sharp, rarely fails to pierce
the jaw, when, in an instant, the whole length
of line will be run out. As no human force
could properly be relied on to check the fish’s
course, the end of the rope is either fastened to
some timber-head, or to a tackle fall: the latter
is preferable, because it adds to the length of
the line, and does not check the fish so suddenly:
without the latter precaution, the rope may be
snapped, or the hook torn away from the shark’s
jaw. The quantity of heavy line, added to the
weight of the hooks and chain, soon bring the
fish under command, when he is towed up to
the gang-way, and there, by means of a slip-knot
passed over his fins, hoisted into the waist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few persons will taste of a blue shark, it
being considered unwholesome; but of the
brown shark, which rarely exceeds five feet in
length, (while the former has been known to
measure near thirty,) most of the seamen will
solicit a steak. The average sizes of sharks may
be from six to twelve feet in length: it is very
common to collect a pailful of young ones, each
about a foot long, that take refuge in the parent’s
maw. Behind the fins are usually several
sucking-fishes, adhering to the shark’s sides:
these are supposed to live upon its blood; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>some doubts may be entertained, at least whether
that is its sole subsistence, when I state,
that in Madras Roads I caught, by means of a
hook and line put out for ground fishes, a sucking-fish
that measured rather more than two
feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sharks are in general attended by what are
called pilot-fishes: these are beautifully striped
blue and white; in form they much resemble
the chub, and may measure from ten to fifteen
inches in length. When the shark displays himself,
the pilot-fishes may be seen playing about
his head and sides; but when the ship is going
fast, and the shark keeps under the bottom, or
stern, at a considerable depth, the pilot-fishes
often rise to the surface, assembling in the eddy
about the stern-post. I never could entice one
of them to touch a bait.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the higher latitudes, the albacore, boneta,
dolphin, &amp;c. may often be seen playing about
the ship in great numbers; sometimes as though
intent on keeping company for scores of miles.
Porpoises are yet more familiar, and delight in
preceding the ship, at a few yards distance; affording,
to those who are expert, excellent opportunities
for striking them with harpoons. The
liver of the porpoise is esteemed by many to be
as good as that of a pig; to which it bears some
resemblance; the body of the fish is by no
means palatable. The flesh of the dolphin is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>extremely dry, as is that of the boneta, which
is commonly replete with small white animalculæ,
not unlike short fat maggots. The albacore
is inconceivably rapacious; often springing
several yards out of the water after the flying-fishes,
as they skim above the surface; which
they sometimes do for full two hundred yards;
their great enemy darting along under their
course with incredible velocity, and rarely failing
to make a prey of one, or more, as they fall
into the water in an exhausted state.</p>

<p class='c008'>While bonetas, and dolphins, may be taken
by almost any bait, the albacore rarely can be
attracted by any device wherein there is not some
resemblance to the flying-fish. I have seen numbers
taken, when the ship has been going fast
through the water, by securing a three-inch hook
to a slip of bacon fat, cut into the form of a fish,
and further disguised by a long white feather,
taken from a goose’s wing, stuck on each side.
The line for such a purpose should be stout laid-cord;
for, though bonetas rarely exceed twenty,
and dolphins forty pounds, albacores will often
be taken weighing from one to two hundred: I
have, indeed, heard of their reaching to three
hundred weight. Their flesh may be compared
with carrion; it being coarse, tough, and very
strong tasted; but, though not pleasing to the
human palate, it is a very choice bait, attracting
all fishes of prey. Albacores sometimes snap at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>log; which is a small piece of triangular board,
loaded at one corner with lead, and fastened to a
long line wound on a reel. The log being lowered
into the sea, will remain stationary; drawing the
line off the reel in proportion to the velocity
with which the ship is then passing through the
water: the number of yards run off, while a
minute glass is emptying, shews the number of
knots, <i>i.e.</i> miles, sailed within the hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not uncommon, when in the vicinity of
islands, to see turtles lying on the surface of the
sea, fast asleep; these can sometimes be taken,
if two or three careful men proceed in the jolly-boat,
paddling her along with an oar out at her
stern. The turtle should be secured by one of
the crew dropping gently into the water, and
swimming very cautiously until he can pass a
slip-knot over the hind fin, generally called the
<em>fipper</em>; the other end of the line being fast to
some part of the boat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Touching at Ascension on our way from India,
for the express purpose of obtaining a supply of
turtles, I had an opportunity of witnessing the
facility with which they may be taken at certain
seasons, when in the act of copulation; as happened
while we were there, in January. The
turtles floated in pairs, in a state approaching
to lethargy; allowing our whale boats to run
along-side of them, without, in general, being
alarmed. The first object was to pass a boat-hook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>over each shoulder of the male, to prevent
his escape; for, on being touched, these invariably
quitted their mates, and endeavored to
strike downwards. The instant the boat-hooks,
were placed, their inverted points acting as
curbs, a third hand dexterously passed the noose
over the fipper, and left the turtle in charge of a
second or third boat, to which the other end of
the noose line was fastened. In that manner we
took about a dozen one morning, in less than
two hours; but were not equally successful in
our operations on shore. There we hid ourselves,
about night-fall, behind the masses of
rock every where scattered on the beach, and,
allowing the females to pass us, with the intention
of depositing their eggs in the dry sand,
beyond the reach of the surf, endeavored to
intercept them in their way back to the water.
Not a doubt was entertained that we should turn
them over by scores; but, with the exception
of one unfortunate female, which by chance ran
headlong against a crag, our hopes proved to
be visionary. The awkward gait of these unwieldy
animals, added to the clouds of light sand
they threw up, completely defeated our most
zealous exertions. We had recourse to our oars,
placing them in the way of the turtle, and using
them as levers wherewith to overturn the
shuffling animals; but in every attempt the turtle
only slipped a little to one side: therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>after breaking several oars, we found it expedient
to desist.</p>

<p class='c008'>While we were on shore, the gulls hovered
about us like so many gnats; absolutely darkening
the air, and perching familiarly on our
heads and shoulders. These subsist chiefly
on the shoals of mackarel cast ashore by every
surf. I am confident that many a heave of the
sea threw up a cart load of those fishes; some of
which were drawn off by the next heave, but
thousands lay along the beach time enough to
be carried off by the gulls. Sharks were to be
seen in every direction, and of all sizes; the
large ones generally swimming near the surface,
with their back-fins exposed to view, and the
lesser ones at about two or three fathoms deep,
on every side of the ship. I was desirous to
catch one of them for the sake of its skin, but
we were so environed by shoals of the <em>chætodon
plectorhenchus</em>, or pleat-nose chætodon, which
took their station much nearer the surface, and
intercepted my baits, though they were tied
down to the hooks with worsted yarn, (some indeed
being enveloped in cloth, and secured in a
similar manner), that not one hook was allowed
to descend to the level where the sharks abounded.
Many hundreds of the <em>chætodon</em> were taken,
and, after being stripped of their skins, which
make a beautiful black shagreen, though in the
water they appear to be chiefly blue and yellow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>were thrown to their greedy brethren, by whom
they were speedily devoured.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should be noticed, for the benefit of those
who may touch at Ascension, either on their
way to St. Helena outward-bound, or in coming
homeward from that rendezvous, that we hooked
several very fine fishes, especially the much-admired
Bull’s-eye, by trailing a bait, about fifty
or sixty yards astern, as we sailed partly round
the island. Close in shore, among the crags,
just beyond reach of the surf, we caught half a
boat load of old-maids in very little time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The modern course of ships proceeding to
India, ordinarily carries them near the Cape de
Verde, and Canary islands; where, if wine is to
be taken in, a detention of ten or twelve days
may happen. This being, in all probability, the
first opportunity that may offer of going on shore,
after leaving England, it may be proper to caution
the young adventurer not to ridicule, nor in
any way to shew disrespect towards, the religious
ceremonies of the Roman Catholics who
possess those islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Under the exercise of prudence and discretion,
all persons landing among the Portuguese are
certain of receiving every civility and attention;
but, when insulted, no race of men are more irascible
or vindictive: the offender is sure to fall
a victim to their unrelenting vengeance! At
either of these islands, but especially at St. Jago,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>abundance of fresh provisions may be obtained:
in all of them the tropical fruits abound, but
should not be eaten to excess; lest a dysentery,
which, in those latitudes, proceeds with hasty
strides towards death’s portal, should ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many vessels, after proceeding down the Atlantic
in a mid direction, between the Azores
and the Canaries, until they catch the trade-winds,
which in that part blow constantly from
the north-east, or nearly so, stretch over to the
coast of Brazil, along which they run, to about
30° south, for the purpose of avoiding the south-east
trade-wind prevailing to the southward
of the Line; then being in the way of variable
winds, they shape their course towards
the Cape of Good Hope. Few quit this coast
without putting into some port for a supply of
wood, water, fresh provision of sorts, &amp;c. Rio
Janiero is the most frequented by British Indiamen,
both on account of its safe harbour, and the
abundance of supplies it can afford. Being in
latitude 23°, it will be requisite to guard against
the great heats incident thereto, and to be careful
not to encounter the nightly dews, which
are here extremely heavy, and give birth to the
most dangerous species of fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>The customs of the inhabitants throughout
this coast being nearly alike, a description of one
portion may suffice for the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives of this part of South America appear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to be particularly inoffensive, and to submit
with perfect resignation to the authority of their
conquerors. They are of a middling stature and
well-proportioned; their complexions dark, and
their hair lank and black. From what I saw of
Pernambuco and Olinda, which lie in about 7°
south, it should seem that the houses of the better
class are well calculated to debar access to
the powerful influence of the sun; which, for
six months, is nearly vertical at the above parallel
of latitude, and does not form a very acute angle
with the northern horizon at any time of the year.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Portuguese have organized several regiments
of the natives, clothed and armed in the
European style: it was not easy to ascertain the
state of discipline of these troops; but, if we
are to judge from the equipment and appearance
of the regiments in the mother-country, it might
be reasonable to entertain some doubts regarding
their prowess.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the intense heat of the climate,
the Portuguese inhabitants omit no religious
duties; nor do they ever appear in that
deshabille we should expect to see generally
adopted among an effeminate people, under such
circumstances in regard to locality. It could not
fail to prove highly amusing, when we beheld
boys, of about six or seven years of age, full-dressed
according to court etiquette, with bags,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>ruffles, swords, &amp;c. representing the more ancient
part of their population in miniature. These
young gentlemen, as well as their seniors, and
especially the ladies, were seen every-where
riding in vehicles very strongly resembling the
chair-palanquins of India, but carried by only
two men; one before and one behind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The profusion of compliments, and of real
civilities, we experienced, were absolutely burthensome;
we were every-where welcomed in
the most kind and liberal manner; barges, rowing
from twelve to thirty oars, were at our command,
to take us to and from the ship, which
could not pass the Bar of Pernambuco, and lay
full four miles from the shore, in seven fathoms.
As to fruits, fish, vegetables, and poultry, they
may be had to any amount, of the first quality;
their beef and mutton are not, however, much
to be praised, and their pork is intolerably fat,
without being firm. This last is one of the
principal viands at the tables of the Portuguese,
in every quarter of the globe, and is dressed in
various ways, all equally offensive to a delicate
stomach. The serenity of the weather rendered
the acquisition of a supply of excellent water
very easy; the casks being floated to and from
the shore; all fastened to ropes, and towed by
the large boats already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The land lying low towards the beach, though
backed at some distance by hills, occasioned us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to be within a few leagues before we discovered
our proximity to the Continent; and we should
probably have run into shallow water, had not a
large floating object been seen about a mile from
us. Our glasses speedily enabled us to distinguish
persons moving on a low frame, that we
conjectured could be nothing less than some
great fragment of a wreck. Boats were immediately
hoisted out, and, in less than half an hour,
we had the satisfaction to see our quarter-deck
covered with a variety of fine fishes, chiefly rock-cod,
that had been taken by the industrious Indians,
whose catamaran we had mistaken for the
remains of some unfortunate vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although we could not converse with these people,
it was natural for us to suppose we were not
far from land; to which they directed our attention,
and by significant signs, as well as by leading
on the catamaran, of which they had hoisted
the sail, pilotted us to the Roads of Pernambuco,
leaving us in good anchoring water, and gratefully
receiving some beads, and other trinkets,
of no value in our estimation, but highly prized
among them, in exchange for the excellent repast
they had afforded to the whole ship’s company.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few days before our arrival at Pernambuco,
the usual ceremonies attendant upon crossing
the Line were duly observed. Those who had
never been so far to the southward, were impressed
with the belief that sundry operations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by no means pleasant, were to take place:
among other things, it was said they were to be
suspended from the fore-yard arm, and to be
thoroughly ducked by frequent dips into the sea.
However unreasonable this may appear, there
exists no doubt of such a practice having been
perfectly common about forty or fifty years back;
it was then regarded as an excellent <em>joke</em>, affording
wondrous merriment to the veteran part of the
crew. In time, the practice ceased; either from
the interposition of good sense, or owing to the
judicious distribution of some liquor among the
chiefs of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>dramatis personæ</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The amusements incident on this occasion are
not very tedious, and, though filthy in the extreme,
cannot be witnessed without exciting
much laughter. About noon, the boatswain,
being full dressed as the god of the ocean, is
supposed to hail the ship, enquiring whence she
comes? whither she is bound? and if any persons
are on board who never before crossed the
great boundary dividing the northern from the
southern hemisphere? After much pompous
and authoritative elocution, wherein Neptune
declares a firm resolution not to relinquish his
rights, he ascends at the bow, under which his
car is supposed to be in waiting, whence, attended
by his mates, whose paraphernalia accord
with the dignity of their office, and the solemnity
of the occasion, he proceeds to the quarter-deck,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>where, after an appropriate speech, he
exercises his powers of divination, and in a few
minutes discovers the several novices who are to
submit to his decrees. His god-head, like his
progenitor of ancient times, invariably has an
eye to business; and as the sea deity of the
Greeks was supposed to delight in ample sacrifices,
so does his descendant, or rather his representative,
of our time, equally cherish the idea
of copious libations in honor of the day. Hence,
there is little difficulty in appeasing his wrath,
and conciliating his good-will towards the vessel
and her crew, by the immolation of from two to
three gallons each, of good rum or gin; which,
being duly tendered to the officiating priests, soon
reach their destination, and avert the threatened
danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>While this is going on, some of the old hands
are busied in the construction of a ship, which
is to be launched in the presence of the deity,
under whose auspices she is to sail the world
over, and back again, in perfect safety! This
important duty is conducted with great precision,
and takes place in the lee-waist, where all
the novices among the sailors, recruits, &amp;c. are
ranged in two rows, face to face, to represent
the ribs of the stately Argo.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual to select some of the more pliant,
or silly, of the party, to form the head and bows:
one of these being placed in the centre, looking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>forward, his head covered with a long swab, of
which the threads hang down nearly to his heels,
and his face being smeared with all the filth the
ship affords, by way of paint, is considered the
typical figure suited to the nomenclature of the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c008'>All being in readiness, the builders attend
Neptune as he retires, in order to allow the
shoars to be knocked away, that the launch may
take place: the captain and his officers aid the
farce by encouraging the passengers to advance
towards the waist, there to view the construction;
when, at a fit moment, the god roars forth
his mandate for committing his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>protegé</em></span> to the
deep. It, however, unluckily happens that the
vessel does not shew any disposition to quit the
stocks; therefore, as she will not proceed to the
water, the only chance of setting her afloat is by
causing the water to proceed to her; which it
accordingly does from some dozens of buckets,
&amp;c. previously secreted in the fore and main
tops, and in the long boat, for that purpose.
This drenching concludes the show, and the
crew retire to make merry upon the amount of
their collections, which, when not sufficiently
abundant to afford a moderate allowance to each,
is liberally augmented from the ship’s stores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sabbath is always observed on board every
Indiaman with perfect decorum: there being no
chaplain on board, unless perchance as a passenger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the captain, or one of the officers, reads
the morning service, and eventually a short lecture
suited to the audience, consisting of all on
board who are not confined by illness. It is not
easy to describe the decency which prevails on
such occasions; the whole standing bare-headed
on the quarterdeck, and refraining from every
act, or look, that might trespass on propriety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many sailors, notwithstanding the character
in which they are generally accepted, are of a
very religious disposition, and are easily led by
those who shew a reverence for the church establishment.
Yet, like most persons bred up in
ignorance, they are shamefully superstitious,
and often entertain notions very little short of
those which actuated their ancestors to throw
Jonah overboard. However ridiculous it may
appear, yet it is strictly true, that among hundreds
of the bravest tars, one wag may, by whisperings,
groanings, &amp;c. aided by a white sheet,
and a hollow intonation, create a most disgraceful
panic. But our terrestrial population, of corresponding
rank, can claim no title to laugh at
their peers on the element. The sermon lately
delivered and printed, by the Rev. Isaac Nicholson,
A.M. Curate of Great Paxton, in the
county of Huntingdon, in consequence of two
attacks on the person of Ann Izzard, a reputed
witch, whereby Alice Russel, who endeavored
to protect that poor woman, was destroyed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>evinces the deplorable state in which the minds
of our lower orders remain, notwithstanding the
great expence incurred for the propagation of the
Scriptures among them, and the infinite pains
taken to instruct those who cannot afford to pay
for education.</p>

<p class='c008'>Funerals at sea can rarely boast of much display,
but their attendants are often sincere
mourners. Confined within a narrow space, the
loss of a companion is not easily forgotten;
every object reminds us of his fate, and exacts
a sigh! Few linger, either of disease, or of
wounds, so long as persons under similar circumstances
would do on shore. The want of
room, of fresh air, of clean linen, of suitable
diet, and of a change of scene, all contribute,
notwithstanding the most assiduous attendance,
to depress the spirits, and to aggravate the symptoms.
Above all, the ravages of scurvy are peculiarly
distressing, and tend most to dishearten:
even those in perfect health become alarmed,
and, from that circumstance alone, often participate
in the dreadful evil.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being utterly inadmissible that a corpse
should be retained on board, no time is lost in
sewing it up in a hammock; placing a few lumps
of coal, or other ponderous matter, at the feet,
to cause its sinking. Thus prepared, it is laid
upon a grating at the lee gang-way; and, after
the usual burial service, at which all attend, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>committed to the deep. In some instances,
during calms, sharks have been seen to dart from
under the vessel, and to attack the corpse in the
most ravenous manner. It is well known that all
sickly ships are attended by many of those fishes;
which, if numerous in the vicinity of a healthy
vessel, are, in the opinions of the crew, the
surest indications of great mortality on board.
Without pretending to doubt the acuteness of a
shark’s sense of smelling, it may be permitted
us rather to ascribe their congregating to chance,
than to their supposed powers of anticipation: at
the same time there can be little doubt, that
certain effluvia must escape from a vessel not
duly purified by ventilation and ablution; and
that such a neglect will rarely fail to induce diseases
of the most malignant description; thereby
giving a latitude, among those who view things
superficially, to adduce instances apparently
confirmative of their assertions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever convenience it may be thought to
afford to the survivors, it appears to me, that
the customary sale of all the effects of the deceased,
indiscriminately in general, is contrary
to the dictates of prudence, so far as relates to
salubrity. That, in such a situation, whatever
is appreciable may produce a better price, cannot
be controverted; but I should rather incline
to think it were better to forego that advantage,
than to risk the dissemination of disease, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>not previously malignant, by an unlimited distribution
of the apparel of one demising under
any clinical distemper. To say the least, perfect
ventilation should be given to every atom;
nor would the trouble or expence (if any) of fumigating
the wearing apparel, and bed-clothes,
be ill bestowed: perhaps baking would be found
the safest precaution.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been stated, that, in rounding
the Cape, the weather may be expected to correspond
with the season of the year: this is so
well understood, that it is only during the summer
season in that quarter, vessels are considered
to be safe in Table Bay, situated to the
north of a low, flat, sandy isthmus, over which
it is evident the sea formerly flowed into False
Bay, lying a few miles to the southward. The
mouths of the two bays have different aspects;
consequently, when a channel existed such as
I have described, the Table Mountain, whence
the northerly bay derives its designation, together
with Cape Town, which stands between the
mountain and that bay, together with Wineburg,
Witti-boom, Constantia, &amp;c. &amp;c. including
a length of about forty-five miles by
four, on an average, in breadth, must have been
insulated.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a ship is to touch at the Cape, it is
very desirable, on every account, that her arrival
should take place during the summer season; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>that she may come to anchor in Table Bay,
about half a mile distant from the wharf. The
convenience, thus afforded, of going immediately
into comfortable lodgings, where nothing
is wanting that can tend to the refreshment of
persons fatigued by those narrow limits within
which they have been confined, probably for
ten or twelve weeks, is not to be calculated.
The Dutch, it is true, are most offensively avaricious;
but that must be compounded for, in
consideration of the satisfaction attendant upon
the liberty of taking exercise in a fine climate,
abounding with the most delicious fruits, the
choicest vegetables, and that kind of social intercourse,
which, chasing away the recollection
of former langour, gives energy to meet succeeding
dulness and inactivity. The British
visitor will, however, experience considerable
disappointment if he expects to witness the
performance of dramatic pieces, or that jocund
hilarity which with us prevails among persons
long resident together. On the contrary, the
inhabitants of Cape Town think of nothing but
money-making; in which they are neither inexpert,
nor very scrupulous. In public, they are
so awkward, stiff, and unsociable, that I have
often been surprised they did not go to sleep at
their visits. If such was the state of society
only a few years ago, what must it have been
previous to the occupation of the Cape, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>the American war, by two French regiments;
which, according to the confession of the Dutch
themselves, <em>made a very considerable improvement
in their breed?</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Few of those who take lodgers will admit
such as do not board with them: the rates are
not in any instance fixed, but the average may
be taken at from three to four rix-dollars for
each lady or gentleman, half-price for young
children, and one dollar for each servant, per
diem. From this it may be collected, that a
single gentleman must be an economist if he
manages to pay his expences of board, washing,
horse-hire, &amp;c. under thirty shillings daily.—The
rix-dollar is fixed at four shillings; but is
an imaginary sum. Notes of any value may be
had; but gold and silver currency are scarcely
ever seen; the Dutch being extremely eager to
obtain guineas at twenty-one shillings currency,
and re-selling them at the rate generally of six
and a half, or seven rix-dollars. Persons visiting
the Cape should be careful to reserve their
cash until about to pay their bills, and then to
account their guineas at their current value, as
above shewn. Such is the estimation in which
bullion is held, that no small coins are any
where to be seen; even shillings, and stivers are
paid in paper currency. Passengers from India
ought to take a bag of rupees of the worst description;
for, whether sicca or tersooly, each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>will be gladly received, without distinction, at
two shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cookery of the Dutch is pretty nearly on
a par with their flesh-meats; their beef, mutton,
veal, and pork, being rarely of tolerable quality,
and invariably made to float in strong sauce, of
which butter and spices are the chief ingredients.
The table is, in most houses, laid in a
central hall, looking into a garden; the floors
are all painted, that they may not absorb the
damp when washed, as they are almost daily:
the beds are tolerably good, and the apartments
of a moderate size. Before every house, is an
elevated terrace, on a level with the ground-floor,
having at each end a seat, usually of masonry
also. On this terrace, called the <em>steupe</em>, the
Dutch promenade half the day in fair weather,
enjoying their pipes, and occasionally taking
their <em>sopkies</em>; which are small glasses of raw
spirits, for the most part hollands, their servants
tender to them at intervals, as a matter of
course.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extensive gardens of the late Dutch
Company, through the centre of which is a
broad gravel-walk full half a mile in length, are
crowded every Sunday evening, and on all festive
days, by a promiscuous group, who walk
in parties, to and fro, under the shade of the
oaks and other trees planted on either side.
There is also an institution, but of a more private
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>nature, and frequented, with few exceptions,
by the Dutch only. It is held at a neat
house, where wines, &amp;c. are sold, having attached
to it a spacious garden; not unlike some
of our tea-drinking places in the vicinity of
London. This is called <em>Concordia</em>; a name
perfectly unsuited to the scenes occasionally
disgracing the interior, which has more than
once excited the attention of our government,
in consequence of the seditious principles of its
visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The late Lord Macartney did not fail to keep
a watchful eye over Concordia, as well as to
check, in their infancy, whatever attempts
might be made to spread, and to inculcate, revolutionary
principles. A large portion of the inhabitants
being descended from delinquents
who had quitted their native country, as Gil
Blas says, ‘not without good reason,’ and having
rarely paid much deference to their rulers
in Europe, it is not to be wondered at, that
those doctrines of the mountain, which condemned
Louis the XVI. should have been
adopted at the Cape. Such was the advance
made in the cant of the day, and so numerous
were the meetings at Concordia, that Lord
Macartney judged it necessary to adopt measures
for bringing his Dutch subjects to their
senses; which he did in a manner that reflected
the greatest credit on himself, and evinced with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>what facility traitors may be subdued under a
just and energetic government. Among the
many who resorted to Concordia every evening,
was a great farmer, known at the Cape under
the designation of <em>Boor</em>, who was particularly
smitten with the new-fangled terms of gallic
civism: if I err not, his name was <span class='sc'>Van
Clootz</span>. He was of immense stature, and
ordinarily wore a round slouched hat, about the
diameter of a gentleman’s umbrella; and as he
paraded through the streets, sitting on the front
board of his waggon, drawn by eight Spanish
horses, always appeared like some enormous
wild beast belonging to Mr. Pidcock’s menagerie.</p>

<p class='c008'>This <em>monstrous</em> great man (long considered
the key-stone of the arch-traitors of Constantia)
was summoned, in a civil manner, by Lord
Macartney; who, in becoming terms, rebuked
him for his folly, and explained the whole extent
of what had been reported, regarding the
proceedings of those who visited the garden.
Mynheer was not to be talked out of his veneration
for the Revolution in France; and declared,
that, in his opinion, it would be equal to a
martyrdom to die in so glorious a cause. It was
in vain his Lordship depicted the horrors attendant
upon so great a reverse; the boor’s enthusiasm
rendered him blind to such trifles, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>all those excesses which inseparably accompany
civil convulsion.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the course of a few days, Van Clootz was
informed, that a troop of cavalry had arrived at a
farm he had on the borders of Hottentot Holland,
about thirty miles from the Cape, and that it was
supposed they would remain some time in that
neighborhood. The boor was delighted at the
prospect of a long bill for hay, corn, &amp;c. &amp;c. folio
after folio; every day’s stay was joyfully noted!
It was not long, however, before complaints were
made that the troopers behaved in a licentious
manner, killing his poultry, destroying his fences,
plundering his garden, kissing his maids, and the
Lord knows what! Now, as most of his stock
was consumed, it was no longer an object for
Mynheer to court the stay of the cavalry; therefore
he went boldly to Lord Macartney with a
long list of damages, and his bill for corn, &amp;c.
demanding, in a very haughty manner, that the
farm should be evacuated by his <em>now</em> unwelcome
visitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Bless me, Mr. Van Clootz,’ said his lordship,
‘why, I thought you was delighted with
revolutionary principles?’—‘Yes, my lord, I am
so; the acts of the French nation should be written
in characters of gold!’—‘And yet, Mr. Van
Clootz, you complain against the troop I sent to
be quartered upon you—no, no, Sir; you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>been so fond of the <em>sweets</em> of revolution, that I
am resolved you shall taste some of its <em>bitters</em>
also: therefore the cavalry shall remain at your
farm, until you acknowledge the benefits of British
protection, and retire peaceably to your
lands, there to cultivate corn, instead of sowing
sedition at Constantia.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The result may be easily guessed: Constantia
was depopulated, and Mynheer Van Clootz was
held in derision throughout the Cape. It should
not remain untold, that, however strict Lord
Macartney might have been during the time he
governed at the Cape, such was the impression
made by his equitable, liberal, and firm conduct,
that, when he embarked for Europe, the inhabitants
were truly grieved; but consoled themselves
under the hope, that a petition they sent
to his Majesty, for the re-appointment of his
lordship, might prove successful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the farms, within the compass of a
morning’s ride, are well worth seeing; not as
objects of imitation, but as displaying much
novelty, and tending to afford a just idea of the
character of a Dutch agriculturist in that quarter.
The vineyards, and depôts of wine at Constantia,
are certainly curious; especially when it is
considered, that the soil which produces that
luscious wine, is confined to a very few acres,
I believe not more than forty, beyond which,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>sets from the same vines, under circumstances of
perfect equality, in regard to site and culture,
produce a very different liquor, little superior to
that sold at the several wine-houses at sixpence
per quart, and possessing a peculiar terraceous
flavor, which does not diminish by keeping.
The stranger not habituated to the use of the
Cape wines, either white or red, should be extremely
cautious on his first arrival to avoid
them; drinking port in their stead. A neglect
of this precaution will produce considerable inconvenience,
and may be attended with habitual
diarrhœa. I was one of four, who, on landing
at False Bay, drank about three or four glasses
each, and were violently affected by it during
the whole of the following night.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many whalers frequent the coast to the eastward
of the Cape, where they kill numbers of
the white species, which supply both spermaceti,
and the oil bearing that name. In False
Bay, which includes a space equal to at least
two hundred square miles, black whales may
often be seen sporting about; as, indeed, they
may, in Table Bay, close in among the rocks,
about half a mile below the fort. A few are
killed by the crews of such ships as have not
been so fortunate as to fill with the former kind;
but it seems to be done almost as much for pastime
as for profit; the oil extracted from black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>whales being very low in price; it neither burning
well, nor making so good soap as the spermaceti
kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the winter months are held to be
very dangerous for vessels riding in Table Bay,
on account of the dreadful swell that sometimes
sets in from the north-west, towards which it is
much exposed, it is, however, rare that vessels
are lost therein during that season; no doubt,
in consequence of their very short stay, and of
their usually proceeding to Seamon’s Bay, the
inhabited part of which is about twenty-five
miles from Cape Town. The Sceptre, of 64
guns, together with a Danish 74, and about ten
or twelve other vessels, were wrecked in Table
Bay on the 5th of November, 1799; a period
when a gale of wind from the north-west is never
expected. To make up for the deficiency, that
part of the year is attended with very stiff
breezes from the south-east, which drive up the
small gravel against one’s face with such force
as to give very acute pain. These south-easters,
as they are called, certainly produce excellent
effects; cooling the air, and destroying an infinite
number of insects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature has been truly liberal in the profusion
of flowers she has scattered throughout this part
of Africa: the plains are covered with heaths,
or hethers, of an exquisite fragrance, of boundless
variety, and of the most delicate coloring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>and formation. The whole country, where the
soil is not absolutely barren, teems with all that
could enrich a pleasure garden; among these,
the wild geraniums bear a large proportion: the
plain beyond the camp at Wine-Burg absolutely
resembling a rich carpet!</p>

<p class='c008'>The opposite side of Table Bay, as seen from
Cape Town, offers nothing pleasing to the eye;
the coast appearing to be low, sandy, and barren,
rising gradually into a range of hills, displaying
little arborage, or verdure, which connect with
those on the east side of False Bay, forming a
part of the district called Hottentot Holland;
wherein are partially interspersed small farms,
that combine to supply Cape Town with provision.</p>

<p class='c008'>The back of the Table Mountain, so called from
its top appearing horizontal for several hundred
yards, indeed, for near half a mile, is rugged, and of
a most dismal hue. When the wind blows from
the westward, the clouds come rolling down,
perfectly concealing the mountain nearly to what
appears to be its base. In that, however, the
spectator is deceived; for a block-house erected
on a part of the hill where the signal port stands,
called the Lion’s Rump, and which is also apparently
near the base, has been ascertained, by
measurement, to equal the highest part of Gibraltar
in elevation above the sea. From this, as well
as from its being discernible at full thirty leagues
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>distance, some idea may be formed of the stupendous
height of the Table Mountain.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears probable, that but for that regulation
which disqualifies persons who unnecessarily
put into harbours deemed at certain periods unsafe,
from recovering their insurances in case of
loss, few ships would resort to False Bay. The
distance, the badness of the road to Cape Town,
the difficulty of procuring supplies and stores,
with various other inconveniences, combine to
give the preference to Table Bay, notwithstanding
the reputed hazard. At Cape Town abundance
of accommodation, of every description,
may be had; whereas, at Seamon’s Bay, there
are not more than two or three houses where
persons of respectability could lodge. In saying
this, I exempt the quarters allotted to the officers,
which are very comfortable. After all that
can be urged in favour of Seamon’s Bay, it is by
no means a safe harbour; as the bones of several
vessels, deep buried in the sandy beach, at the
most retired part, which is a perfect <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cul de
sac</em></span>, sufficiently corroborate. There are, besides,
sunken rocks near its mouth, on which several
ships have struck: one, called the Anvil, from
its flat surface, caused the loss of the Colebrook,
Indiaman, some years ago. Another, designated
the Bellows, from the perpetual roar it occasions,
stands about two miles from the southernmost
point of the Cape: it is not so dangerous as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>others; being discernible full ten miles off,
owing to the immense surfs, arising from a strong
current towards the westward, which are perpetually
breaking over it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Cape, considered as a colony, cannot be
said, at present, to be valuable in any respect,
except as an asylum for shipping, homeward or
outward bound. The supplies requisite for the
town are derived from the labors of a few boors,
settled at some distance. Hence, provisions are
by no means cheap; nor would they be so, even
if the demands of St. Helena could be answered
from any other quarter; since the indolence of
the Dutch agriculturists would, it is to be feared,
cause them to limit their operations in proportion
as the consumption might decrease. It is, doubtless,
owing to some such cause, that the greater
part of the slaves are maintained upon a very
black, heavy kind of bread, on which the fat of
sheeps’ tails is smeared, as a substitute for butter;
and that the lower classes of the population
live in the most wretched manner. This should
seem inexcusable, where thousands of acres of
good soil lie unheeded, within such a moderate
distance of the town as could scarcely fail to repay
the ordinary expences of cultivation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although neither coal, nor peat, is found at
the Cape, and the colony is dependant entirely
on the arborage of the vicinity for fuel, it is very
remarkable that little, or rather no, pains are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>taken to insure a supply. If we except a few
plantations, made purely for ornament, at the several
garden-houses within six or seven miles of
Cape Town, we may in vain search for any symptoms
of foresight in respect to the future supply
of so indispensable an article. I recollect stating
this to a gentleman, who seemed to be, in other
respects, well informed of Cape affairs; but he
silenced me with a remark which appeared unanswerable;
taking for granted it was true. He
said, ‘We have endeavored, ever since taking
possession of the colony, to induce the Dutch
to plant, and to till, the adjacent lands; but in
vain: they prefer a scarcity, or at least a pretended
one, on all occasions; because they think it distresses
us, while, at the same time, they have an
excellent plea for extorting the highest prices.
Possessed of his waggon, and team, Mynheer
can always supply his own wants at a certain
rate; but if more is brought than is required for
his own use, the surplus is spared to us for a sum
which covers the whole expence: therefore, the
dearer the article, the better for the waggon-master!’</p>

<p class='c008'>I am free to confess, that where such hauteur,
indolence, and extortion prevail, and that, too,
very extensively and actively, against a protecting
power, (for we really do not appear as conquerors
in that quarter,) I should not hesitate to
adopt such measures as might fully meet the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>exigency. If, in so doing, I should wound the
feelings, or partially injure the rights, of the inhabitants,
my argument would be brief, viz. ‘You
created a necessity, and necessity has no law.’
Though, here and there, something resembling
an European vehicle may be seen, the general
instrument of conveyance, whether of families
travelling, or taking the air, is a waggon, usually
drawn by eight small, but fiery horses. One
Hottentot commonly holds the reins of the pair
next the wheels, while another, with an immense
whip, not less in the whole than thirty feet long,
manages the team with wondrous dexterity. In
these waggons are commonly three benches,
slung crosswise, on leather straps; each bench
holding two persons. They are likewise provided
with painted canvas tilts, made to take off at
pleasure. The motion of such a waggon, while
going over the rough part between the two capes,
is ‘<em>most horrible!</em>’</p>

<p class='c008'>The lumber-waggons are made in the rudest
manner, generally with large truck wheels; some
are boarded, or even thatched, above, and absolutely
look like moving houses. Whether owing
to the awkwardness of their construction, or to
the badness of the roads, or to that incorrigible
thing called custom, may not be easy to decide;
though, possibly, their joint operation may be
reasonably considered the cause; it is certainly
true, that, even with six or eight pairs of rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>stout, but high-boned, oxen, such a waggon
rarely travels more than twelve or fifteen miles
within the day. Nor is the plough a whit better
managed. This stupendous machine, which
appears calculated to turn up whole mountains
in its progress, rarely gets through more than
two roods daily, though drawn by six oxen, all
in a line, and aided by three men; one of whom
holds the plough stilt, (there being but one,)
another drives with the usual enormous whip,
and the third guides the leading ox.</p>

<p class='c008'>The operation of thrashing is commonly performed
in the open air, within an enclosed circle,
about twenty yards in diameter, surrounded by
a stone, or mud wall, about four feet high: the
floor is made of clay and lime, rammed very
hard. The sheaves being scattered within the
circle, the farmer’s horses are turned in, and
driven about by a slave, who, being provided
with a whip, stands in the centre, and chases
the cattle about; while two, or more, of his
associates in bondage, stir the sheaves with
forked sticks, in order that every part may be
equally trodden by the galloping steeds. The
winnowing is done in the same area; the horses
being sent into another circle, to repeat their labors,
while several men, first removing the straw,
sweep the thrashings towards the windward side,
and there toss it up, that the wind, which is commonly
rather forcible, may blow the chaff to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>lee side, while the corn falls nearly centrical; of
course, as the latter goes with little further preparation
to the mill, the flour may be supposed
to contain no small portion of grit. The quantity
of grain bruised, and left in the straw, must
be considerable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few ships remain long enough to allow of passengers
proceeding to the interior; where, however,
they would find much to admire. At some
of the farms they may be well accommodated,
with the great advantage of finding their purses
far less burthensome on their return! The famous
vineyards of Stellenbosch are well worth
seeing, as is the Salt Lake, which annually dries,
leaving a bed of muriate of soda many miles in
diameter, and of unknown depth! Surely, in
parts accounted sterile, such a depôt of manure
ought not to be overlooked. The hot baths, situate
in a most romantic valley about forty miles
from the Cape, demand the traveller’s attention.
Whether he may proceed on horseback, (as I
should recommend,) or in a waggon, a gun will
be useful; both on account of the prodigious
quantity of game, of every description, and as
a defence against the numerous wild beasts which
infest all the woody country beyond Hottentot
Holland.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been induced to enter upon the foregoing
details regarding the Cape, from the consideration
of its being intimately attached to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Asiatic possessions; and because so large a
portion of those who visit them, touch there;
either in going to, or when returning from, India.
The political importance of a point so advantageously
situated, and having such an expanse of
territory annexed, may, perhaps, at some convenient
moment, become a subject for future discussion:
in the mean while, as connected with
the Cape, I shall treat of St. Helena.</p>

<p class='c008'>This island is most singularly situated, being
in the 16th degree of south latitude, and separated
from the two continents of Africa and
America by immense seas, in every part unfathomable:
from the former it is about 1200
miles distant; from the latter about 1800. According
to an analytic description, published in
1805, it appears tolerably certain, that Saint
Helena owes its elevation above the sea to some
great convulsion of nature; probably to, an earthquake:
for it does not, like its neighbour Ascension,
shew much remains of volcanic matter,
neither does there appear any cavity at all resembling
a crater. On the contrary, the whole
island is composed of immense strata of rock,
chiefly basaltic, which, from the variety of
directions they assume, some declining one way,
some another, while a few assume nearly a perpendicular
tendency, may be supposed to have
been disrupted, and ejected from the great sub-marine
mass, by some tremendous earthquake.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>It would be difficult to form the least idea of
the period when that event took place; nor, indeed,
can it be altogether certified that this
island was not coœval with the creation; since
which it may have undergone various changes,
from volcanic operations within the deep: the
appearance of cinders without lava, and the
regular intermixture of clay, especially of puzolana,
with the rock, by such a gradual intercourse
as to leave it undetermined where the
one begins, and the other ceases, may be considered
a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>lusus naturæ</em></span>, and certainly tends to
involve the origin of this now valuable island
still more among the arcana of nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Situated in the heart of the trade winds, and
covering so small a space, the whole island giving
a girth of less than twenty-eight miles, it is
not to be expected that much rain should fall
upon it: such is the incertitude regarding a
supply of water, that for three years in succession
scarce a shower fell! This severe drought
proved fatal to a very large quantity of cattle,
which had, during the course of many preceding
seasons, been raised by the industrious efforts
of the inhabitants. Such were the chagrin,
and the disappointment, felt on the occasion,
that few have, since that period, turned their
attention to the rearing of live stock in any
quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Water would never be wanting, if proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>means were taken for its preservation; as almost
every valley has a copious spring, the produce
of which might be retained in tanks lined with
the clay every where abounding. These tanks
should be situated as near as possible to the
spring heads; being dug in the form of a cone
resting on its base, so as to leave but little surface
for evaporation. By this means they might
be kept in a continual state of overflow, from
the upper tank or cone, to others below the
level of its surface, at such distances as should
be judged proper. The source of the spring
supplying the stream that flows through James’s
Valley, whence the shipping receive their water,
cannot be less than six hundred feet above the
level of the sea; therefore, admitting that a succession
of tanks were to be made at such places
as might be best suited to the retention of water,
and to the supply of cattle, &amp;c. it follows, that
any quantity, beyond the actual consumption,
might be upheld for times of scarcity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot fail to astonish my readers, that no
means whatever have been taken to prevent
even the stream above alluded to from being
lost, when they are informed that it is computed,
indeed, has been known to supply no less than
two thousand tons in three days; and could have
furnished a much greater quantity, had it been
practicable to bring more boats, at the same moment,
near enough to the wharf-cocks, to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>the hoses laid into their respective casks. I have
heard, that a computation of the spring was
made, whence it was shewn to be equal to that
conduit which supplies Liverpool. Now, the
whole population of St. Helena are supposed to
be rather under, than over, 3000; which, compared
with Liverpool, at once displays the possibility
of guarding against drought; though the
lands should be stocked to their utmost with
cattle. This, of itself, is sufficient reason for
the adoption of some plan for preventing the
escape of the surplus fluid; which ought to be
retained as high up as possible; but when we
consider, that, under such an improvement,
agriculture would thrive in situations now
deemed untenable by any farmer, merely from
a want of water, there ought to be no hesitation
in resorting to the proper means for securing a
due supply throughout the island.</p>

<p class='c008'>We should, at the same time, advert to the
regular operations of nature, which ever conform
to the changes produced, either by time or
by art. The naturalist well knows, that in all
well wooded islands, however distant from continents,
the dews are remarkably heavy, and
encourage vegetation to its utmost luxuriance:
if, then, the soil could again be covered with
arborage, (for, when first discovered, about three
hundred years ago, the very summits of the hills
were amply clothed with trees, of which some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>were peculiar to the island,) it is obvious, that,
even without the aid of irrigation, an abundance
of perpetual pasturage might be found. In that
case, every acre might have its inhabitant;
whereas, at this day, computing the whole area
to measure, according to a very accurate survey,
about 30,300 acres, and the population to be
3000; it should seem evident, that, although
there is not more than one inhabitant to every
ten acres, at least four-fifths of their provision
are drawn from other countries.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author of the ‘Description of St. Helena,’
quotes some anecdotes which shew the
narrow views of those persons who have never
quitted the island. In one instance, ‘a top-mast,
or other spar, is reserved as a great acquisition,
to be sold at an immense profit to
some vessel in distress:’ in another, the author
states his having been asked, ‘if the arrival of
the India fleet did not make London very
gay!’</p>

<p class='c008'>In these, we certainly recognise the language
of insulated ignorance; but when the author
makes a jest of that exclamation of a native,
who, in walking with him over a spot luxuriantly
verdant, declared, that ‘if the whole island
were like that part, it would be the richest spot
in the world;’ the joke does not fit. I am well
aware of the hyperbole of such an enthusiastic
expression; but, from what appeared at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Government House, where, under the fostering
care of Colonel Brooke, the late governor, wonderful
improvements had been affected, especially
in the culture of exotics; and having witnessed
the great perfection to which vegetables
had been raised, on a farm in the occupation of
the late Major Edward Smyth, of the artillery;
as well as the plantations upheld, under most
inauspicious circumstances, by the late Deputy
Governor Lieutenant-Colonel Robson: I feel
no hesitation in avowing an opinion, that the
now dreary, bleak, uncouth summits of St. Helena,
might become both ornamental and useful;
while the lower parts should teem with corn,
wine, and oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a climate where no hurricanes destroy the
crops, where the medium temperature is about
54°, where health and longevity seem to hold their
court, and where there exist the greatest essentials
towards culture, (viz. clay, lime-stone, sand,
and manure, in the greatest abundance,) I really
cannot see why this now neglected, and comparatively
desolate, island, should not become a perfect
paradise! That health should be a common
blessing among the natives, does not appear wonderful;
because they have not the means of excess,
at least not in drinking; for wine, and spirits,
are most exorbitantly dear. I happened to
be at Governor Brooke’s on New Year’s Day,
1800, when intelligence was brought that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>whole of the troops were plunged into the deepest
affliction, by the loss of a cask of rum, served
from the stores as the usual basis of annual festivity:
in rolling up towards the barracks, the
cask had burst, and spilled every drop of its precious
contents. This, in any other situation,
would not have given a moment’s uneasiness;
the deficiency might have been easily made up:
but, at St. Helena, where the most sparing economy,
in regard to all articles of subsistence, is
indispensably necessary, and where no private
suttlers could fill up the blank, it was really a
most uncomfortable circumstance!</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot be expected, after the above detail,
that provision should be cheap, or abundant: so
far the reverse, that persons of all ranks daily
receive their rations from the stores, as indispensable
towards their existence. Hence, sheep,
poultry, flour, &amp;c. are rarely procurable, in any
quantity, for the supply of the homeward-bound
shipping; which, being sometimes detained for
months, waiting for convoy, occasions their passengers
to be put to considerable expence, without
deriving proportionate comfort; valetudinarians
being the only strangers, who, in such cases,
experience the smallest benefit from the detention.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be difficult to state the expences
incident to residence at any of those houses
where lodgings are let: which includes all, excepting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>about half a dozen of the seniors on the
island: the rates vary according to the demand
at the moment, or the expectation of early arrivals.
It may be concluded, that cheapness neither
is, nor can be, the characteristic of James
Town, when I observe, that, merely for the use
of an apartment, such as nothing but the change
of scene would have induced me to occupy,
wherein I occasionally slept on a truck-bed,
whereof the whole apparatus might safely have
been sent to the paper mills, the charge made was
twelve shillings daily, or rather nightly; for I
never ate a meal in the house. Let it not be
understood that I speak this in derogation of the
people: far otherwise; I experienced all the civility
they had the opportunity of shewing, and I
really believe they regretted their want of means
to render my slumbers more refreshing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Their exertions might, perhaps, have obtained
me a more comfortable lodging, but there were
other matters far beyond their power to remedy:
among these may be noticed the myriads of
cock-roaches, (or <em>blatta gigantea</em>,) which at night
crawled about the bed; offending not only by
the very unpleasant sensations produced by their
claws, but by their peculiarly nauseous scent.
As for rats, of no small breed, nor, indeed, confined
to one species, they made as free, at all
hours, as though they had paid for their lodging,
and absolutely seemed to approach with perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>indifference: their gallopings, not only within
the walls, but over me as I slept, together with
some very unceremonious pulls at my hair, (for
I then used powder,) at length compelled me to
sleep, when opportunity offered, on board the
vessel, wherein our stock of these devastators,
though not insignificant, was considerably less
numerous, and far more reserved. We had,
however, abundance of cock-roaches, about two
inches in length, and an inch broad; but, owing
to the pains taken to catch them by means of
saucers filled with oil, of which they are extremely
fond, their numbers were greatly reduced;
but we could never hope for their extirpation, as
every crevice afforded them shelter, and the opportunity
of depositing their eggs in safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be asked why I did not move to some
other house? In reply thereto, it will be only
necessary to observe, that I was recommended
to the good folks, or they to me, (I forget which)
by a gentleman to whose urbanity and kindness I
was under much obligation: besides, I was daily
in hopes of quitting the island; therefore judged
it most expedient to remain where I was, lest I
might, by avoiding Scylla, stumble upon Charybdis.
There are one or two shops in James
Town, where goods of various descriptions are
sold. I had occasion to buy a hat, for which I
paid ten dollars, and on my arrival in England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>found that it could never have stood the exporter
in more than twelve shillings, even under
a salt-water invoice. But it was the best that
was for sale, and I was compelled to the purchase.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such ships as have touched at the Cape, on
their return from India, are usually well stocked
with every species of provision, and even import
their own fuel; according to existing regulations:
were they to be supplied with that article,
or indeed with any other, to much extent, the
distress occasioned to the inhabitants would be
deplorable. This deficiency of fuel is occasioned,
at present, by the number of wild goats, every
where secreting themselves among the crags;
during the night time they descend to the plantations,
and to the fields, cropping every thing
within their reach. Until a war of extermination,
as is now proposed, be carried on against
these destructive animals, it will be useless to
attempt planting, at least on such a scale as
should prove beneficial to the inhabitants. It
may justly be supposed, that no weak measures
could produce so desirable a result; but it is
reasonable to conclude, that, if a party of soldiers
were to be posted daily on those superior
points whence the goats could be seen and
alarmed; and if a number of half-bred greyhounds
were to be kept to run them down, much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>might be done in the course of a few years;
especially if a reward were given for every goat
destroyed, by whatever means.</p>

<p class='c008'>Yams and potatoes are cultivated in tolerable
quantities on various parts of the island; but the
former will not grow except in very choice situations,
such as vallies through which streams flow.
In Major Smyth’s grounds, an immense variety
of our esculents were to be seen, growing luxuriantly:
I recollect his pointing out to me a
peculiarity regarding the leek, and the onion,
in both which he had been frequently disappointed,
after planting them to stand for seed.
As an experiment which did not promise success,
he sowed the little seed vessels which
form the globular head of the stems; and found,
that, by so doing, he could insure a regular, and
very rapid succession. He cut off the heads, and
separated the capsules, when they were in their
green state, but rather inclining to maturity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having undoubted proof of the readiness with
which many plants, indigenous to the cold, as
well as to the hot, regions, may be naturalized
at St. Helena, it must excite some surprise to
be informed, that no public measures have yet
been taken to stock the island with a variety of
quick-growing and useful trees; which, being
collected on favorable spots, might serve as the
depôt for future supplies. The various species
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>of palms thrive amazingly, as does the peepul;
of which, for a long time, there was only one in
the island, and no person could tell whence it
came!</p>

<p class='c008'>It seems curious, that peaches should thrive
so luxuriantly, and acquire such an admirable
flavor, notwithstanding the dryness of the atmosphere:
formerly, this fruit was in such abundance,
that large quantities used to be given
to the hogs. Unhappily, an insect, only to
be distinguished by the aid of glasses, was
imported with some slips from the Constantia
vines: these attacked the peach trees, devouring
their bark, and destroying at least nine-tenths
of their number. It is said, that every means
have been tried to annihilate these minute plunderers,
or to deter them from their wonted attacks,
but without effect. I recollect, that,
about twenty years ago, a premium was given
by some association, (probably the society for
the encouragement of arts,) to a person who
discovered a means of ridding trees from this
description of clustering insects. It was very
simple; and was effected by boring holes with a
gimlet, obliquely downwards, into the body of
the trunk, near the ground, and filling them
with quicksilver; after which the holes were
closed by means of pitch, or plugs of wood. As
possibly this has never been essayed at St.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Helena, I give it a place under the hope of its
proving useful: it is, however, said to render
evergreens deciduous.</p>

<p class='c008'>The teak, and poon trees, both of which are
of important service in naval architecture, might
certainly be raised to great size in St. Helena.
The burghut, or banian tree, might also thrive;
but I should except against it as requiring too
much nourishment, and exhausting the soil,
without being any wise useful as timber. The
tamarind tree, though it supplies a large proportion
of fruit, has this objection against it, that it
is peculiarly unfriendly to all others in its vicinity:
no grass will grow under it; and persons
who sleep beneath its shelter, or within its influence,
are subjected to fevers: its timber is
substantial, being hard and heavy, but by no
means strong, on account of its tendency to
rive, and to start into fissures; especially at
those knots whence boughs have been thrown
out. The bamboo may be cultivated to very
great advantage: it grows, throughout India, on
the most elevated situations, and on spots where
scarcely a handful of soil is to be found in the
vicinity of its roots. The value of this reed, (for
it is nothing more, though it reaches to the height
of seventy feet, and frequently measures from
five to six inches in diameter,) would be incalculable,
were it applied merely to making fences;
which, in such a climate, would be very durable.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>An invaluable acquisition would be obtained
from its more general culture, especially as it is
of very quick growth. But the most important
advantages would certainly attend the formation
of vine-yards, in such parts as might, by their
aspect and soil, be best suited to the purpose.
The temperature of the climate is highly favorable,
the thermometer averaging, during the
summer season, from 76° to 79° and 80°, and
rarely falling below 54°. That great enemy to
grapes, rain, is not much to be dreaded; though
it cannot be doubted, that in proportion as vegetation
should be increased by assiduous planting,
and by preserving due supplies of water for the
upper levels, more dew and more rain would
fall: however, not to such excess as to ruin
the vine-yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coffee has been found to thrive here; but I
much doubt whether it would be an object to
cultivate that which is so abundant throughout
the West Indies, and which can be so amply
supplied from countries, whence it comes as a
return for our own manufactures.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great, at least the primary, object should
be to add to the resources of the present inhabitants,
and gradually to effect such an excess of
provision, of their own raising, as should allow
of liberal assistance being given to such ships as
might touch at the island; especially to vessels
from the South Seas, whither numbers of our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>whalers now resort, and to such as might, either
intentionally, or accidentally, miss the Cape.
This may certainly be effected, by active perseverance
in a well arranged plan; the difficulties
are really few, and the means, of remedy
certainly within our power. After maturely
weighing the <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em>, no doubt remains
in my mind, that, in the course of fifteen or
twenty years, St. Helena would not only cease
to be a burthen on the parent state; but that it
must be able to afford a large portion of its produce
to the accommodation of all shipping visiting
its roads.</p>

<p class='c008'>This island cannot boast of a harbour; nor are
its Roads so extensive as to admit a very numerous
fleet, owing to the small extent of the bank
on which ships cast anchor; generally in from
six to fifteen fathoms. After the latter depth,
the bank falls off so suddenly as to become unfathomable,
within a few hundred yards, rendering
it necessary to lay in, as close as the
surf admits, probably about two cable’s length
from the beach. But it is not very easy to get
so near in the first instance, on account of a
strong current that sets to the north, and the
necessity for being close hauled to meet the
wind which comes down James’s Valley. It is
best to anchor any where about twelve fathoms,
and, when the wind lulls, to warp into a better
berth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>There is but one landing place, which lies to
the left of a shallow inflexion, forming a small
bay opposite the sea-line; built nearly on a level
with the water, and mounting a very heavy battery,
properly equipped for heating shot, and
always kept in readiness for service. Not that
it would be possible for an enemy to surprize
the island, unless the most shameful inattention
might prevail in every quarter. All vessels must
approach on the south-east; where there are
guards, and telegraphs, whereby notice is given
full four hours before the northernmost point
can be rounded. This, of course, alludes to the
day; but, so clear is the atmosphere in general,
that even during the night a ship would be discerned
at many miles distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>After passing the southernmost points, it is
necessary to keep well in with the shore, which
is every where composed of immense masses of
rock, without any inlet, or means of disembarkation;
even if the tremendous surf should
not impede. Here the coast is guarded, or
rather watched, by various detachments, stationed
at commanding points; where strong batteries
are mounted, and the means of communicating
intelligence, in the most rapid manner,
at hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last battery to be passed, previous to
casting anchor, is called Munden’s, and stands
immediately between the watering, or landing-place,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>and a small bay, in which, it is recorded,
that a landing was once effected during the
night: from my own observation, having often
gone in a boat to the edge of the surf at that
part to fish, I should think it by no means easy
to get ashore in any manner, much more as an
armed body intending to capture the island.
But, whatever may have been effected in former
times, that quarter seems now so well guarded
as to leave no cause for apprehension, of a surprize
at least: nor does there appear the smallest
danger of a landing being effected at the watering
place; where a very small party might
oppose the boats of a whole fleet. The swell
is here very great, rendering it a matter of some
hazard when jumping into, or out of, a boat;
besides, only one boat can come to at a time, in
a position suitable to hostile purposes; and it is
not to be supposed, that the battery above, or
that on the landing-place, or the sea-line, or the
works on Ladder Hill, would be silent upon such
an occasion. Certain destruction awaits every
person who falls into the water in this part;
where the sharks are as numerous as they are
ravenous. The wall of the wharf is perpendicular,
and built on a rock, under which is a tremendous
abyss.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole of the northern part is composed of
rocks naturally scarped in a rugged manner, so
as rather to hang over, than to retire from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>sea; rising every where from 800 to 2000 feet,
and more. Yet, wonderful as it may seem,
with such force does the surf break on this leeward
side of the island, that the spray, or mist,
may be seen constantly ascending, like clouds
of smoke, nearly to the summits of the mountains.
The residue of the coast is equally bold,
and inaccessible; except at a part called Sandy
Bay, to the southward. There the shore is
nearly flat for some distance, but is interspersed
with rocks, and guarded by reefs of breakers,
which project some distance, and totally obviate
the means of attack. If, however, a landing
were to be effected, the guns kept in readiness,
in masked batteries on the surrounding
heights, would soon defeat the enemy’s purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>On account of the difficulty of approach, the
several ships take their water in regular rotation,
unless when a vessel is under despatch; in
which case her boats have the preference. The
mode of receiving water is certainly suited to
the situation; but is very tedious. The butts
being carried in the long-boats to the edge of
the wharf, are there filled by means of leathern
hoses, of which the ends severally attach to
cocks on the pipes that conduct the water to
that part. With the upmost assiduity, I should
suppose that not more than forty or fifty butts
could be supplied to any one long-boat within
the course of the day, notwithstanding the shipping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>lies so close; but, by a regular succession
of boats, full 1000 butts might be received.</p>

<p class='c008'>After landing, the way leads under a very
high hill on the left, to the sea gate; within
which is a barrier that secures the flank of the
sea-line, and defends the road into the town; it
is terminated by a gate, where the main guard
is posted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The town is small, and by no means irregular;
the houses very low, generally consisting of two
and three floors, in all which there are abundance
of windows, glazed with small panes,
which, on the whole, are not very sightly.
The valley, in which James Town is situated,
is very narrow, and, in the hot season, extremely
sultry. On the right is Ladder Hill, where a
very heavy battery is mounted, both of guns
and mortars, effectually commanding the road,
and the valley, for a great distance. This hill
is so steep, that it is ascended only by means of
traverses cut out of its side, and enclosed with
a parapet sufficient to prevent accidents. The
soil is, however, so replete with large loose
stones, as to occasion frequent mischiefs to the
houses below; of which some have been greatly
damaged by the fall of rubbish from above. I
imagine, that the ascent, by the road, cannot
measure less than a mile; and, that the perpendicular
height of Ladder Hill, above the level
of the sea, must be full 600 yards.</p>

<p class='c008'>This very elevated part, namely, Ladder Hill,
is nevertheless commanded by several small batteries,
judiciously situated, which, in their turn,
are subject to the fire of the works at High
Knoll, built under the auspices of Colonel
Brooke, and under the immediate direction of
Major Smyth. This little fortification seems to
be the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>dernier resort</em></span> of the garrison, of which it
might hold about two hundred in the several
bomb-proofs. It has a small arsenal, reservoir,
magazine, a well of immense depth, cut through
the rock with great difficulty, and, exclusive of
its outworks, which are peculiarly compact, has
a central block-house, mounting several pieces
of heavy ordnance. The site of this citadel is
shewn to be full 1960 feet above the level of the
sea: the highest peak in the island is about
2700; but it is too remote to have any effect on
the citadel.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>The force kept up at St. Helena is, nominally,
a battalion of infantry, and four companies of
artillery; but I doubt whether, at any time, more
than 700 men could be mustered: that number
is barely equal to the defence of the several outposts,
and to manning the sea-line, Ladder Hill,
and the citadel. It is, fortunately, a very healthy
spot, and the hospitals are rarely known to contain
more than four men in the hundred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The surrounding ocean supplies abundance of
fish; Mr. Brooke describes no less than seventy-six
kinds, though few are much esteemed. From
the stern of a ship, mackarel, of a small size, together
with gar-fish, plaice, a kind of cod, and a
very fine species of gurnet, may be caught. The
best bait for these is a piece of raw albacore.
Chance supplied us with a very excellent stock
of craw-fish: under the idea of catching some
small sharks, we made a net of spun-yarn, and
slung it to a butt-hoop. A few bones of salt
beef were tied within for a bait. This we lowered
down at night, and occasionally drew up
very gently to the surface, the depth being about
ten or eleven fathoms. We caught no sharks,
but frequently found two or three very fine craw-fishes,
of that sort called stumps.</p>

<p class='c008'>I will now proceed with the regular order of my
design, and observe that, if a ship is not to touch
at the Cape outward bound, especially when
that port is in possession of an enemy, or that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>hostile cruisers are known to infest the southern
coast of Africa, it is not uncommon to run
down to the latitude of 38° or 40°, thereby to
avoid those dangers, and to get beyond the influence
of the current, which sets to the westward
at the rate of full three miles per hour.
Experience has proved, that, by taking such a
course, the voyage has been quicker than when
the land has been kept in sight. When the Cape
is thus avoided, it will probably be necessary to
proceed by the inner passage to the island of
Johanna. This is supposed to be the best route
that can be followed, by such as are bound to
Bombay; though the number of shoals, and of
rocks, scattered through the Mozambique Channel,
which separates Madagascar from the Main,
subjects it to some disrepute. These are, in a
measure, counterbalanced during war time, by
the danger attendant upon an approach to the
island of Mauritius; whence the French have
always fitted out a number of privateers, that
have done inconceivable mischief among our
shipping in the Indian Seas.</p>

<p class='c008'>A few vessels touch at St. Augustine’s Bay,
on the west coast of Madagascar; but the
treacherous disposition of the natives is a great
objection, and causes the generality to pass on
to Johanna, which is the only island of the
Comora cluster we have been in the habit of visiting.
The strong current setting round its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>southern extremity, occasions vessels to keep
close to the shore as they approach Saddle
Island, which, at low water, is connected with
Johanna by a ridge of sand, whereon the Huntingdon
Indiaman was lost about forty years back,
in attempting to pass, without going round Saddle
Island; which derives its name from the appearance
it bears, when viewed at a certain
distance. The whole coast, from the southern
point to the bay where the town is situated, presents,
with very little exception, a bold shore,
divested of those dangerous reefs which render
Mohillah, and others of its neighbours, difficult
of access. The country is extremely mountainous;
in some parts abounding with cocoa
and other trees: wild goats are very numerous;
but, being much in request among the natives,
are very shy, and, in general, retire to the most
rugged eminences. To the left of the town,
about two miles distant, a long reef of black
rocks encloses a bay, of which the beach is covered
with a fine sand, shelving very gradually,
and bearing a strong resemblance to that of Weymouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The houses in the villages on the coast are
rather mean, though appertaining to persons who
have ridiculously assumed European titles of
eminence. The island swarms with ‘Prince
Ruperts,’ ‘Prince Eugenes,’ Dukes, Marquises,
and Lords, all of whom are mean and knavish
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to an extreme. The common form of building
consists of a long barn-like apartment, entered
by a low door in middle of its length, and having
another opposite thereto at the back, which
leads to the most dirty out-offices that can be
imagined; wherein the culinary operations, &amp;c.
are carried on. In the dwellings of those who
admit lodgers, which may be said to include half
the town, the places for sleeping, for I cannot
call them bed-places, are raised, towards the
two gable-ends, to the height of full six feet;
and, in some, are parted off by a curtain of
coarse chintz, or other cloth. These recesses
are from three to five feet in width, and may
be ten or twelve feet long; according to the
breadth of the house. The ascent to them is
formed by several very broad stairs, ordinarily
covered with matting made of cocoa-tree leaves,
or, in a few, with carpets. Each step is considered
as accommodation for two persons to repose
upon, feet to feet: in most instances, however,
the steps are not long enough to allow
more than one person to lie down. This theatrical
arrangement is by no means displeasing,
nor is it attended with so much inconvenience as
would be the case were the whole upon a level.
The middle of the room is set apart for meals,
usually served on tables of a wretched construction;
the guests sitting, as well as they can,
upon little stools, or eventually reclining on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>matted floor against the lower steps; which, by
the by, is not only the most comfortable, but,
among the natives, is considered to be the most
decorous, mode.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inhabitants of this island, which lies in
12° south, and 45° east, are chiefly descendants
of some Arabs who settled here about two centuries
ago. Its name is, properly, <em>Hinzuan</em>, from
which we have, by a series of corruptions, contrived
to affix the present designation. Most of
the inhabitants who are not of Arabian descent,
are slaves, purchased for a mere trifle at Madagascar
and Mozambique, with which places some
intercourse is preserved; though the Johanna
marine seems but ill suited to crossing even that
narrow sea, which separates it from either Cape
Ambro, or the opposite coast of Mozambique.
The number of vessels called war-boats, may
amount to about twenty, each capable of carrying
two hundred men. These barks, which are
entirely open, are usually furnished with an
immense number of paddles, and oars, which, aided
by a large square-sail, cause them to make
good way through the water. In such a temperate
climate, where the wind always blows from
the south-west, and where, with the exception
of those hurricanes peculiar, to the higher latitudes,
fair weather prevails during the whole
year, such a naval armament may prove adequate
to the ordinary purposes of its construction.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>All warfare with any of the neighbouring
islands, is supported by voluntary contributions;
each person of consequence taking with him
provisions, and arms, for his respective adherents,
or slaves. The revenues are collected
from about two hundred villages; but the three
principal towns are exempted from any contribution
beyond the fortieth part of their moveable
property; which all, of whatever degree,
pay annually to the Mufti, or head of their
church.</p>

<p class='c008'>The king resides at the large and populous
village of Domoni, where his whole train of
artillery, consisting of a condemned six-pounder,
is kept in great state! The natives are, in some
degree, conversant in the use of small-arms;
these, with cutlasses, spears of immense length,
and bows and arrows, (the latter chiefly pointed
with fish-bone, or flint,) compose their stock of
military implements. Their coast being generally
so safe, little skill is required to bring a
vessel into a safe berth; but it is usual to take
on board a pilot, who is known by the name of
‘Purser Jack.’ This copper-colored knave
never fails to put off, so soon as any vessel is
seen on its way from Saddle Island, and to offer
his services, which are supposed to be well requited
by a few dollars.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is worthy of remark, that, on account of
the rapidity of the current, which sets off to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>sea round the black rocks, and would infallibly
prevent any vessel from reaching an anchorage,
all ships pass to the southern extremity, near
Saddle Island, and proceed with a fair wind
along the coast. But it is not safe to carry too
much sail while under the shore; as violent
gusts come down between the mountains, in the
most abrupt manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The population of Johanna must be rather
considerable: perhaps it were not too much to
estimate it at ninety, or a hundred, thousands;
including all ranks and ages: the towns are
large and extremely populous. The Mahomedan
religion prevails, though but very few
sacred edifices, worthy of notice, are to be
found on the island; the principal one, which
does not seem to have cost any great sum, being
a mosque, built by Halimah, a queen from
whom the present king is descended, situated
near the landing place, in the town of Matsamudo.
Nevertheless the priests are sufficiently
numerous; and, as in most countries, enjoy an
excellent share of the earth’s produce.</p>

<p class='c008'>The areca-nut, which grows wild all over the
island, but especially on its borders, is here
chewed with shell-lime, as practised throughout
the East: wild pine-apples, plantains, and the
greatest variety of tropical fruits, are scattered
over mountains exhibiting a verdure of peculiar
richness, and presenting, on the aggregate, one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of the richest scenes imaginable. Not a horse
is to be seen on the island; but plenty of excellent
cattle thrive uncommonly on the rich pastures
of the vallies; through most of which
streams of the purest water, every where broken
by rocks, or gliding over shallow beds of gravelly
sand, pursue their eager course. It is
rather peculiar, that, among other poultry, the
Guinea fowl should abound; thousands may be
seen in a wild state, if it may be so termed,
when, by throwing a handful of grain at your
feet, all will instantly approach to participate of
the bounty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Musquitoes are here exceedingly troublesome,
and attack the plethoric mariner with avidity.
It is said, that no snakes, or other venomous
reptiles, are to be found at Johanna; but,
in exchange for that blessing, they are plentifully
supplied with bugs. The only vehicle
known in the island consists of a machine, termed
a palanquin; but which is, in fact, nothing but
a litter made of clumsy net-work on a rough
frame, and borne by four men, who each take
an end of the two side-poles of bamboo on their
shoulder. This splendid piece of ingenuity is
appropriated solely to the conveyance of his
majesty, and of such nobles, and European,
or Arabian visitors, as may obtain permission to
visit him at Domoni.</p>

<p class='c008'>Angling is little understood at Johanna, yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>large <a id='corr117.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='quantites'>quantities</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_117.1'><ins class='correction' title='quantites'>quantities</ins></a></span> of good fish are occasionally to
be had. These are either taken by night lines,
or are speared by persons standing at the heads
of canoes, who, with wondrous dexterity, strike
such fishes as approach the surface. This
practice, common throughout uncivilized countries,
is in great perfection among the Nicobar
Islands.</p>

<p class='c008'>I make no doubt, that, if proper means were
used, an excellent supply of stumps might be
obtained. What I have said on this subject,
when describing St. Helena, would, most probably,
be found equally efficacious in many
other insulated situations, under warm parallels.
On the shoals which lie within the channel of
Mozambique, immense numbers of cowries, called
by us ‘<em>Blackamoors’ teeth</em>,’ are dredged up:
these being current as money in most parts of
India, are exchanged, together with live oxen,
for arms and ammunition, hatchets, knives,
nails, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The oriental practice of dying the hands and
feet red, by means of the <em>hinna</em>, which here
glows wild in the utmost luxuriance, prevails
throughout the island; especially among the
females, who color their lips and gums black,
with a peculiar preparation, similar to the <em>missy</em>
of Hindustan, in order to make their teeth <em>appear
to advantage!</em> Although the men are extremely
jealous, the women of the lower class are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>allowed to walk the streets, provided they wear
veils. We must not by that word suppose that
any particular part of their dress is so termed,
or separately made for that purpose: the only
mode of concealing the face consists in drawing
the cloth, or sheet, which is thrown over the
head, so as to cause its meeting forward, leaving
a very narrow opening to enable the wearer
to see her way.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to the mercantile operations of
the Johanna people, I cannot afford a clearer
idea than attends the description given by Alwi,
a man of some consequence on the island, to
Sir William Jones, who has recorded it in the
following words. He said, ‘His country was
poor, and produced few articles of trade; but if
they could get money, they might easily procure
foreign commodities, and exchange them
advantageously with their neighbours in the
islands, and on the continent. Thus, with a
little money,’ said he, ‘we purchase muskets,
powder, ball, cutlasses, knives, cloths, raw cotton,
and other articles brought from Bombay;
and with these we trade to Madagascar for the
natural produce of that country, or for dollars,
with which the French buy cattle, honey, butter,
and so forth, in that island. With gold,
which we receive from your ships, we can procure
elephants’ teeth from the natives of Mozambique;
who barter them also for bars of iron,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and ammunition; while the Portuguese in that
country give us various kinds of cloths, in exchange
for our commodities. These cloths we
dispose of lucratively in the three neighbouring
islands; whence we bring rice, cattle, a kind of
bread-fruit, which grows in Comora, and slaves;
which we buy also at other places where we
trade: all this traffic we carry on in our own
vessels.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The foregoing should evince, that, under
an effective government, for the present may be
deemed a mere toleration of royalty, the island
of Johanna might become important among its
neighbours; and, so long as European vessels
should continue to touch there for refreshments,
might, carry on a brisk trade. Yet the total
want of any thing like a harbour, must inevitably
prove a great drawback on its prosperity.
While there, our ship was driven by a sudden
squall, issuing from between two immense
mountains, from her anchorage, though she had
two anchors out, and rode within a short half
mile of the beach; and this, too, in remarkably
clear weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mode of killing whales in the Mozambique
Channel, and by the Africans all along
their south-east coast, is extremely simple; it
shews how much may be effected by perseverance;
and affords, indeed, an admirable moral,
together with no insignificant satire upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>great expence to which Europeans, engaged in
that pursuit, put themselves, without becoming
more certain of success.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a whale is seen within a moderate distance
of the shore, basking, as they often do
for hours together, with little intermission, during
the heat of the day, the fishermen put off
in their canoes, which are excavated from large
trees, and equipped with out-riggers on each
side. Generally, each canoe carries from four to
six persons; but those which are intended to
approach the whale, give over their crew, with
the exception of one spearsman, and one paddler,
to the other canoes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The paddler urges his canoe very gently, until
within about eight or ten yards of the whale;
sidling up with extreme caution so as to be parallel
with its shoulders; this is done to avoid
that lash of the tail which the fish invariably
gives, as he plunges downwards, on feeling the
spear enter his flesh. The weapons used on this
occasion are about five feet long, extremely
elastic, and loaded at each end with iron or
lead; whereby not only the impetus is encreased,
but the vibration, occasioned by the opposite
weights, causes the point, which is of iron,
very acute and barbed, to wriggle deeper into
the flesh. Previous to striking, the head of the
canoe is turned towards the whale, and a slight
retrocessive motion is given; so that, at the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>moment when the spear is delivered, the paddler
may, by a sudden exertion, pull further away,
and avoid the danger. It sometimes happens,
that the spearsman is thrown from his station
into the water, by the sudden motion of the
boat opposed to his own action; being invariably
expert swimmers, such an accident is not
in the least regarded. After sinking to a great
depth, the whale rises again to the surface, perhaps
a mile off, where other boats are waiting
to repeat the attack; by a succession of which
he is, ordinarily in the space of an hour, so
completely worn out, as to float without the
power of resistance, when a long spear, pushed
through between his ribs, speedily terminates
the struggle.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whale being dead, all the canoes join
their efforts to tow the carcase towards the
shore; where, upon some sandy part, a division
is made of the spoil; each of the crews cutting
away with hatchets and cutlasses, as much of
the blubber as they can expend. The residue
is sold, or exchanged for other articles of consumption,
dress, &amp;c. to the inhabitants of the
neighbouring towns: the whale-bone is reserved
for sale to European traders; the ribs serve for
the couples of houses, or rather cabins; and
the joints of the vertebræ, after being neatly
trimmed at the sides, and at one end, make very
comfortable stools; of which, however, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>strong, rank scent, retained for many months,
would prove highly offensive to any but persons
who consider the blubber, after the oil has been
fried, and pressed out, to be a delicate morceau!</p>

<p class='c008'>The operation of cutting away the adipose
parts; which come off in immense lumps, of
from eight inches to a foot, or fifteen inches in
depth, is rather laborious; it is likewise attended
with the danger of attacks from an immense
number of sharks, that instinctively follow the
carcase; and, so soon as it is hewn open, seize
whatever falls from it with the most ferocious
avidity. Hence, the fishermen are obliged to
be extremely careful not to expose their limbs,
by allowing them to dangle in the water: such
of the crews as fall overboard, are usually snapped
up by their greedy competitors; which, it
is said, are known in these parts to grow to the
enormous length of thirty feet!</p>

<p class='c008'>It has often occurred to me, that, in lieu of
casting loose the remains of whales, after cutting
away the blubber, as our fishermen usually
do, an immense quantity of ammonia might be
extracted, were the skeletons to be towed to
the shore, and there to be applied to that purpose.
Fuel is rarely wanting, and there being
invariably sufficient crews on board our whale-ships,
which cannot be always employed, it
should seem that much advantage might thus
arise, with little or no expence: the price of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>ammonia is very high, but if it could be lowered,
immense quantities would be consumed. It is
to be remarked, that this valuable alkali has
not hitherto been put under that course of experiments
to which it certainly would be subjected,
did the price not stand in the way of its
use on a large scale: the following qualities, as
stated in the invaluable Dispensary given to
the public by Dr. Andrew Duncan, may plead
in apology for my digressing so far on a subject,
not apparently connected with my prospectus;
but which, considered philosophically, is, by no
means, irrelevant thereto.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Duncan states, that, ‘<em>ammonia</em> does not dissolve
animal substances; it extinguishes flame;
colors vegetable-blues green; is decomposed by
being transmitted through a red hot tube, and,
by the electric spark, into its constituent gases,
and by oxygen, and atmosphoric air at a red
heat; by oxy-muriatic acid, it is converted into
water and hydrogen-gas. It is absorbed, without
change, by porous bodies; it dissolves sulphur
and phosphorus; and combines readily
with water, in all its states. <em>Ammonia</em> combines
with the acids, forming neutral salts. It is formed
during the putrefactive fermentation; and is
commonly classed among the alkalies.’ My
readers will see, at once, how wide a field is
open for speculation!</p>

<p class='c008'>After quitting Johanna, which is the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>island, in that cluster, whither European vessels
ever intentionally resort, such as may be bound to
Bombay usually make the great peninsula somewhere
about Anjengo, pursuing their course up the
western, or Malabar side; while those proceeding
to Coast and Bay, (<i>i.e.</i> Madras and Bengal,)
endeavor to get a sight of Dondra-Head, which
determines both their latitude, and their longitude;
thence they pass round the eastern side of
the island of Ceylon, of which the shore is sufficiently
bold to allow their keeping within two or
three miles of the land with perfect safety, in
regard to reefs or shoals; but this quarter being
extremely subject to violent gales, that come on
rather suddenly, or, at least, without much notice,
and are known by the name of ‘white
squalls,’ it is generally considered most prudent
to keep a good offing. These white squalls invariably
take place when the sky is free from
clouds; but may sometimes be distinguished, as
they approach, by the white spray raised from
the water by the violence of the wind: so soon
as that is discovered, all the small sails should
be taken in, and the ship rendered as compact
above as time may admit. The warning spray
is too frequently unnoticed; and, even when
perceived, is, for the most part, too close at
hand to admit of much preparation. This insidious
danger extends, more or less, from the
south end of Madagascar up to the latitude of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Tranquebar, being most prevalent to the southward
of the Line, where the south-west trade
wind prevails at all times.</p>

<p class='c008'>The island of Ceylon has been adopted as a
royal possession, in the government of which
the Company have no share whatever. The
whole of the civil establishment are appointed
by the king; and the military receive their commissions
from the secretary at war, independent
of the Company’s chartered establishment. It
generally happens, however, that some of the
Madras battalions are on duty in the island;
which has always been in a most perturbed
state, especially since it came under our dominion.
It is rather unusual for the Company’s
ships to touch here, except when sent to Columbo
with stores, or calling there on their way
home for cargoes and passengers. None but
very small vessels can pass between Ceylon and
the Main, notwithstanding the great width of
the channel, on account of that immense reef,
intermixed with shoals, stretching across its
northern part. This reef, called ‘Adam’s Bridge,’
is supposed to be formed by the summits of
mountains, that, by some dreadful convulsion,
were sunk below those waters, between which
they originally formed a stupendous isthmus,
like that of Darien, connecting Ceylon with the
continent.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>Notwithstanding what has been said by many
authors on the subject of ‘spicy gales,’ the expectation
of meeting with perfumed breezes in
this quarter should not be too much encouraged.
After coasting the whole length, from Dondra-Head
to Point Pedro, not one puff, conveying
the idea of proximate ambrosia, ever reached my
nose. It must, at the same time, be understood,
that a certain terraceous scent, something
like that resulting from rain in dusty weather,
generally prevails within a certain distance of
a windward shore; particularly where the
country is well wooded.</p>

<p class='c008'>After passing to the northward of Ceylon, the
navigation becomes more difficult; there being
immense shoals stretching, in various directions,
all the way from Tranquebar up to the mouths
of the Ganges. It is generally opposite some
short interval between these dangerous shallows,
that our principal settlements are situated. Thus,
Tranquebar, Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Negapatam,
and some others, to the southward of Madras,
enjoy a partial benefit in that instance;
but, to the northward, our principal sea-ports
are under very considerable disadvantages, arising
from the great distance at which all vessels,
with the exception of very small coasters, are
obliged to lay out in an open road, subject to the
fury of storms, and to the depredations of privateers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>which seldom fail to take advantage of
these localities, whenever the season may allow
them to visit our shores.</p>

<p class='c008'>The shallows may easily be distinguished at a
considerable distance: being composed of light,
shifting sand, and acted upon by a strong current,
the water above them appears discolored;
assuming a dun, or yellow hue, sufficiently contrasted
with the deeper parts, to enable the eye
at once to trace their respective limits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Madras Roads being exempt from shoals, for
some miles on either side, are entered without a
pilot; ships in general anchoring off the fort, in
from six to ten fathoms; the bottom a firm
sand. The surf is here, at all times, rather high;
but when a south-west, or westerly wind, prevails,
becomes so tremendous as to debar all
communication with the shipping. From the
beginning of October to the middle of January,
the flag-staff is struck, as a signal to vessels that
no insurance is payable on account of such losses
as may happen during that period, which is held
to be replete with danger. So great is the apprehension
entertained of the perils attendant
upon a continuance on the Coromandel coast
during that monsoon, that even our ships of war
retire from the protection of such trade as may
be carried on by adventurous individuals, and
seek an asylum in some well-sheltered port,
such as Trincomalee.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Before we obtained possession of that admirable
harbour, our fleets were under the necessity
of going round annually to Bombay; there
they employed their crews in putting the respective
ships into complete order, against the ensuing
season; whatever vessels required substantial
repairs, being taken into dock. In the mean
while, the enemy’s fleet went to the Mauritius,
which could be easily reached at any season;
and whence they could return full a month before
our’s could get back from the Malabar coast.
The serious losses occasioned, both to the Company,
and to private traders, by such management,
(which then appeared to be inevitable,
though not so in reality, since Bengal could
have received and repaired them,) rendered it a
desideratum to obtain some port, not far removed
from our principal settlements. The fortune of
war once put us in possession of Trincomalee;
but, somehow or other, it was re-taken: as we
have now command over the whole of Ceylon,
it is to be hoped we shall have the wit to keep it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The construction of keeled boats being, in
many respects, unsuitable to intercourse between
the shipping and the shore, recourse is
always had to the common country boats, called
‘masoolahs;’ which, however rude their formation
may appear, are perfectly adequate to every
purpose, and convey both goods and passengers
with general safety.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>These masoolah-boats may carry from forty to
sixty tons; they are made of plank, about two
inches in thickness above, and three below,
fastened together by means of coir; that is, the
fibres of cocoa-nut rinds, passed through small
holes pierced along the edges of the several
planks, all around each: these planks appear as
though sewed together with twine of the above
description, and are fastened to battens and
sleepers, answering for ribs and floor timbers.
At the bottom, planks are laid in the opposite
direction of these, which form the vessel, and
near the gun-whales, several thwarts are secured
across; they passing through the sides, and
being firmly pinned in. There is no deck, and
the rudder consists of a large kind of oar, rigged
out at the stern.</p>

<p class='c008'>At a little distance, the masoolah-boats look
like rude imitations of our coal-barges: they
row from ten to sixteen oars, and when unladen
make more speed than persons accustomed to
wherries, or to ships’ pinnaces, would expect;
getting through the surf, both coming and going,
with amazing facility: though sometimes,
owing to letting them swing round, instead of
steering head-on, they fill, or overset: but this
very rarely happens; and the mere act of ‘swamping’,
unless in the first, or outward surf, is not
attended with any imminent danger; the next
wave generally impelling the boat, and all that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>it contains, high (but not <em>dry</em>,) upon the beach,
where it is soon run up out of the water’s way.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to encourage the boatmen to exert
themselves towards saving any Europeans who
may be in danger, owing to a masoolah-boat’s
upsetting in the surf, the Company allow premiums,
generally medals, to such as may prove
their title thereto. Several of the Company’s
servants, and others, owe their lives to the activity
of these people, a few of whom have been
enabled to retire upon a very comfortable subsistence
allowed to them by those gentlemen
they had rescued. It is much to be lamented,
that the Company have never been able to adopt
the only efficient means of breaking the surf for
a few hundreds of yards; namely, by conical caissons,
forming an angle in front of the landing
place. Nature has done this for the Portugueze
at Pernambuco, forming a bar of coral, at the
end of which is a battery: the sea at all times
breaks with tremendous violence upon the Bar,
and sometimes, though very rarely, dashes over
the guns. The supposed objection will be, that,
owing to the great expanse of the coast of Coromandel,
nothing could be made to resist the
force of the water. But, in answer to this, I
must observe, that Pernambuco is much more
exposed than Madras, it being subject to the
force of the trade winds, blowing all the year
round from the south-west, across that immense,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>uninterrupted ocean lying between the two continents
of Africa and America, while a very
strong current at the same time sweeps round,
and causes the surf to rise with full as much
violence as in any part of the East. At Pernambuco,
vessels lie within the bar, where the
water is perfectly still, and deep enough for
those of four hundred tons to ride clear of the
sandy bottom. At Madras, we could scarcely
expect to see so extensive a desideratum obtained,
as should afford shelter to the numerous
ships of great burthen which frequent its Roads;
the expence would be enormous; otherwise, we
should be as well able to form such a barrier
there, as the French were at Cherburg. It
may be said, that the inconvenience attached to
the works at the latter place, namely, a vast
accumulation of sand, would follow: that would
by no means be likely to take place in so very
strong a tide, with deep water at hand; and if
it should, might perhaps rather tend to facilitate
the measure, and to augment the strength of the
defences.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is indispensably necessary, when going
ashore at Madras, or in any part where the surf
runs high, to be well covered with a boat-cloak,
or some ample exterior clothing; for, even under
the best management, and during the most favorable
weather, the spray will rise around the
boat, completely wetting whatever finery may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>be exposed to its action. Nor must it be considered
any way extraordinary, if a large portion
of that surf which propels the boat, should pour
over her stern or quarters, so as to drench the
whole party!</p>

<p class='c008'>The masoolah-boats are, with great propriety,
under the sole management of the master-attendant,
or the beach-master. None can put off without
licence; and no person can be admitted to
serve on board who is not an expert and bold
swimmer. I believe, that instances of individuals
of any description being lost are extremely
rare: such as are enumerated, took place chiefly
at the outer surf, (there being usually three following
waves to pass, or to accompany,) where
the water is very deep, and where immense
numbers of ground-sharks are ever on the watch
for what accident may throw in their way. It
may readily be supposed the shore is tolerably
bold, when it is explained, that our Indiamen,
deeply laden, have been several times necessitated
to warp to the very edge of the outer surf,
in consequence of an enemy’s fleet having entered
the Roads, with the view to cut them out.</p>

<p class='c008'>So soon as a vessel is seen standing into the
Roads, signals are hoisted, which it is expected
she should, if a man of war, or a Company’s
ship, be able to answer. On her approach to
the anchorage, a boat puts off, with a deputation
from the beach-master, to enquire whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>she comes, as well as to take the purser, &amp;c.
ashore with the despatches. In this first boat,
a number of debashes are sure to arrive, bringing
with them various articles of provision,
fruits, &amp;c. as presents to the captain and officers;
whose favor each of them courts, under the
hope of being employed as the agent for the
ship, or for the supply of necessaries, and for
providing lodgings for individuals.</p>

<p class='c008'>These debashes are generally men of property,
and of some consequence among the natives,
owing to their having at times so many purchases
to make for those who arrive at Madras;
but especially where the supplies necessary for
a whole ship, or sometimes for a whole fleet,
are in question. They all speak broken English,
understanding far beyond what they can
express in our language; they are servile to an
extreme, and most completely trained in every
money-making device.</p>

<p class='c008'>The provision brought on board usually consists
of half-starved mutton, buffalo-beef, which
might safely be classed with carrion, some tolerable
fowls, with, eventually, a few ducks and
geese, yams, biringals, capsicums, and other
vegetable productions. Fish abound in the
Roads, yet are rather scarce, and are very
rarely brought on board: this is in a measure
owing to the greater number of fishermen being
private servants, who are obliged to supply their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>masters first. It is said, that the water-serpents,
which abound in the Roads, and may be
seen, in beautiful varieties, to rise, at all hours
to the surface, destroy great quantities of the
smaller kinds: this I can easily suppose to be
true; but, having occasionally seen the catamarans
returning from the offing, with immense
loads of the best sorts, it would be difficult to
convince me, that the scarcity of fish in the
market, and on board the ships in the Roads,
does not proceed from either the want of industry,
or of regulation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few people, taking all things into consideration,
are more hospitable than the Europeans
residing at Madras: where deficiency in that
respect is supposed to exist, we may, by due
consideration of peculiar circumstances, relating
to the person, or to the place, always find some
sufficient apology. Being so much frequented,
and the number of European gentlemen resident
on the spot being comparatively trifling, it cannot
be expected they should keep open house,
or indulge their friendly dispositions in the
exercise of unlimited kindness. In fact, the
expectations of those who visit Madras, on their
way from Europe to India, are, for the chief
part, rather too sanguine: they have heard
much of Indian hospitality, and wonder at that
disappointment which is purely the offspring of
their own unreasonable anticipations. I know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>not of any situation where a letter of introduction
is of more avail, or indeed more necessary,
than this: but such letter should be addressed
to some person resident at Madras; else it may
be perfectly nugatory, in consequence of the
immense expanse over which the civil servants,
as well as the military, are scattered. A young
gentleman taking out a dozen letters, may, on
his arrival, find them entirely useless, in consequence
of the parties being absent from the
presidency.</p>

<p class='c008'>The passengers of every class are expected to
reside on shore during the ship’s detention in
the Roads. Few, indeed, neglect to avail themselves
of the opportunity offered of seeing one
of our principal fortresses, and of observing the
customs of a country so celebrated in history,
and forming so essential a branch of the British
Empire. If an introduction is obtained, by any
means, the usual result will be an invitation to
reside with the gentleman if he keeps house;
otherwise, every attention will be paid in seeing
the stranger accommodated, at the best house of
that description which admits boarders; and
which are commonly called ‘Punch-Houses.’
This designation doubtless arose from the habits
of those who first settled in India, and who,
finding spirits, sugar, and limes, (a small species
of lemon,) every where abundant, indulged
in copious draughts of punch. That beverage is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>now completely obsolete, unless among sea-faring
persons, who rarely fail to experience its deleterious
effects. In all sea-ports, taverns, or
punch-houses, are more frequented than in
places where shipping lie in some distant road,
or harbour. This occasions them to be more
respectable in the opinions of those who keep
them, but nothing could reconcile a gentleman,
long resident in the country, to seek an accommodation
among them: it would imply a total
want of respectable connexions: and, in itself,
appear sufficient cause for avoiding his acquaintance:
so different are the customs of different
places!</p>

<p class='c008'>Totally ignorant of the language, and without
any guide, it is not to be wondered that so
many impositions are practised on our countrymen
on their arrival in India. A debash of the
lowest order, and of the most crafty disposition,
perfectly experienced in all the ordinary requisitions
of Europeans, and prompt to gratify their
desires so long as profit attends the speculation,
is ever at the elbow of the novice, serving as
banker, purveyor, pimp, and interpreter. What
more can be requisite to ruin an helpless, inconsiderate
youth?</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the gentlemen in the Company’s service
reside in the fort, or at houses a few
miles off, in the country, or at St. Thomas’s
Mount, about six miles from Madras, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>the Artillery are usually quartered, together with
the troops destined to defend the works in case
of attack. The incursions to which the Carnatic
was formerly exposed, during the times of
Hyder, and of Tippoo, rendered it expedient to
fortify the Black-Town; which is very extensive,
and contains the houses of many highly respectable
European merchants, chiefly British and
Portugueze, together with the entire property of
the richer natives of rank and consequence. I
cannot say the Black-Town is an enviable site
for residence; but the situation, being subject
to the land and sea breezes, the latter of which
are as refreshing as the former are debilitating,
reconcile the older inhabitants to many inconveniences,
among which, smoke is by no means
the least obnoxious. The musquitoes are here
tolerably numerous, as are also rats of all sizes,
cock-roaches, and scorpions: the latter grow to
an immense size, and are peculiarly venomous.
That most loathsome companion, the bug, is to
be found here in such swarms, that it is by no
means uncommon to see them crawling about at
all hours, and in all places.</p>

<p class='c008'>St. Thomas’s Mount is certainly the more pleasant
station and may be fairly put in competition
with any of those rural retreats, called
‘Garden-Houses,’ scattered every where in the
vicinity of the capital: at these, many families
reside all the year round; the gentlemen who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>have offices to attend, being conveyed thereto in
the mornings, either in palanquins, or in their
carriages; the climate by no means favoring
much exercise on horse-back.</p>

<p class='c008'>Except at that season when the flag-staff is
struck, Madras Roads are, in general, much resorted
to by shipping. Being the seat of government
on the Coromandel coast, it necessarily
has become the emporium of that side of the peninsula.
Most of the China ships touch there,
and very few of those proceeding to Bengal omit
to call; especially when war either prevails, or is
expected to break out. It is much to be lamented,
that no means have yet been devised, nor, indeed,
appear easily practicable, of rendering the
Roads safe against the attack of an enemy. The
fort certainly could repel any attempt to land
within the reach of its cannon; but there does
not appear any possibility of preventing an enterprising
enemy from causing all the shipping,
either to surrender, or to run ashore. Perhaps
hulks might be so stationed, as to become very
efficient in the defence of whatever shipping
might remain beyond the surfs. One or two old
64 gun ships properly prepared against boarding,
might, at all times, suffice, if moored with
chains in proper situations, under cover of the
batteries.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being indispensable that every person should
be conversant with the several coins, or currency,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>in which payments are made, or accounts
kept, I recommend to my readers to make themselves
acquainted with the tables of coins,
weights, and measures, in use at Madras: observing,
that, throughout the dependant provinces,
an endless variety in the two last are to
be found; and that, consequently, all dealings
must be regulated in proportion to the encreased,
or diminished, variations, wherever situated.
The ‘<span class='sc'>East India Directory</span>’ will be found
to contain whatever may relate to this subject,
including the three presidencies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conceiving, that, with few exceptions, the
customs of many classes among the natives of
Bengal, assimilate greatly with those of the population
on the coast, I shall now pass on to the
ordinary occurrences attendant upon the arrival
of a ship off the Sand-Heads, in the Bay of Balasore.
It has been already stated, that the voyage
from Madras to Bengal will depend, in regard
to duration, entirely upon the season. If the
southerly monsoon prevails, Point Palmiras,
which is at the southern boundary of Balasore
Roads, may be made in from three to seven
days: during the northerly monsoon, it is usual,
experience having confirmed what accident probably
first suggested, to stretch over to the opposite
side of the bay upon a wind, and then to
run obliquely across on the other tack, so as
to arrive in soundings of the mouth of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Hooghly, where the tides will speedily convey
a vessel up to any place on the river, notwithstanding
the wind’s direction. During the passage,
under the former prevalence, the land is
not, in general, seen until the water becomes
obviously discolored with sand. In the first instance,
the course is made directly from Madras
Roads, to gain a good offing, whereby the dangerous
shoals of Pulicat, about five miles north
of Madras, may be avoided: the land all along
the coast being invariably low, and the shallows
projecting, in some places, full ten miles seaward,
it is prudent to keep rather towards
the middle of the bay, and, from a N.N.E. course,
to change latterly to a N.N.W; rounding in,
when the latitude directs, until Point Palmiras
may be from four to six leagues distant.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is of infinite importance to be correct in
making that point, which is best regulated by a
perfect knowledge of the latitude, there being a
promontory very similar thereto, thence designated
‘False Point’; by mistaking which many
vessels have been lost. When in sight of Point
Palmiras, it is usual to await the arrival of some
pilot-vessel, of which one or more are always on
the look-out below the Sand-Heads, and to proceed
into the river under her guidance. The
capture of several of those vessels having occurred
within these few years, in consequence of
French privateers anchoring, as though in want of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>pilots, thus taking advantage, in the most infamous
and unprincipled manner, of an institution,
that ought ever to be held sacred, has given
occasion for many precautions, which must inevitably
be attended with inconvenience, and
even danger, on particular occasions. In lieu of
proceeding boldly towards vessels anchored at
the usual <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ne plus ultra</em></span>, the pilots now draw off
towards the channels, allowing the ships to follow
at some distance, and refraining from sending
a boat on board, until, by their knowledge of
the soundings, the schooners may be placed out
of danger. If all should prove right, which is
soon ascertained by the signals made by the
mate sent on board the ship to be piloted, the
schooners may then proceed with confidence;
but if any suspicion should remain, an alarm
would instantly be given; and, if possible, the
enemy be decoyed among those dreadful shoals,
where, being once entangled, he must fall an
easy prey to such force as might be sent against
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are various channels by which a ship
may proceed to the harbour of Kedgeree, situated
many miles up the river, but those most
frequented, especially by such as import, are
the middle, and left channels, which have, however,
barely three fathoms and a half at low
water; consequently, ships of burthen are commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>brought to anchor, in such positions as
may allow their taking advantage of the best
part of the tide for passing the shallows: nevertheless,
the sand is ploughed up, by the action
of a ship’s passage over them, in such manner
as would lead one, at first sight, to conclude
she were touching the ground, when perhaps
her keel is many feet above it. During daylight,
the pilot-schooner makes few signals, but,
after night-fall, on every heave of the lead, she
communicates, by means of <em>maroons</em>, (which are
flambeaux of an immense size, alternately exhibited
and concealed in a large tub,) the exact
soundings in which she is proceeding. No greater
care can possibly be taken, than in the Company’s
pilot-service, to conduct ships in safety:
exclusive of character, there is much at stake;
for no pilot who loses one of the Company’s
ships, is retained on the list: he is, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ipso facto</em></span>,
dismissed. This regulation, which, no doubt,
may, in a few cases, press hard on very meritorious
individuals, must be considered one of the
most important props of the institution, among
persons who may have habitually indulged in
the use of spirituous liquors to a dangerous excess.
I knew some of the pilots who were perfectly
sensible of their failings, and could not be
induced, either by temptation, or entreaty, to
taste of any beverage stronger than water or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>country-beer, until they had seen their charges
moored in safety. That being done—good bye
to forbearance!</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not a little wonderful, that men who have
the power to overrule a dangerous propensity,
merely when their professional characters are at
stake, should at every other moment throw aside
that curb, which, if duly maintained, would
preserve their health, and render them far more
acceptable members of society!</p>

<p class='c008'>The country all along the sea-coast, on both
sides of the river’s mouth, being extremely low,
and there being no hills of sufficient altitude to
be distinguished at sea, especially on the right
bank, very little gratification is offered to the
eye by the surrounding scenery. The shelving
beach, on either hand, is overgrown, in most
parts, with trees rarely exceeding twenty feet in
height, whose stems are surrounded with under-wood,
or grass jungle, in which abundance of
deer are to be found. The pursuit of sport must,
however, be invariably desisted from, on account
of the immense numbers of tigers which
occupy the same covers. It rarely happens that
a party land for the purpose of shooting deer, or
wild hogs, (which are equally abundant,) without
meeting with some accident; or, at least,
being frightened so as to produce the most salutary
forbearance. About twenty-five years ago,
a son of the late Sir Hector Monro was carried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>off by a tiger from among his comrades, who had
seated themselves round a large fire, made to
obviate the apprehended danger, while they
awaited the arrival of a boat that was to convey
them back to their ship.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the way, from Balasore up to Kedgeree,
the prospect, if we except those agreeable sensations
arising from the display of vegetation, and
from arriving at the ultimate thule of destination,
rather wearies than pleases: nothing is to
be seen but a series of wilderness, perhaps here
and there enclosing a few huts, or, in the broken
intervals, displaying some insignificant village,
of which the inhabitants are as poor as they are
idle. No public edifice; no gay villas; no busy
hum of men; no crowded wharfs! In fact, I
scarcely know a spot more dreary than the debouché
of the Hooghly, for at least thirty
miles; or until arrival at Diamond Harbour.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is usual for the pilot-schooner to return to
the Roads, in search of other importations, unless
her tour may be over; in which instance,
she proceeds up to Calcutta; leaving a person
on board, lest the vessel should drag her anchors,
and to prevent her getting into foul ground.
The purser, for the most part, avails himself of
the attendance of the <em>chokey-boats</em>, which are
always plying about the mouth of the rivers for
the express purpose of receiving packets. In
favorable seasons, these boats have been known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>to reach Calcutta, distant full sixty miles, in one
tide. If a schooner should be proceeding up
the river, there should be no hesitation in embarking
in her: no equal accommodation can,
in general, be had: the whole risk, trouble, and
delay, attendant upon making a passage in any of
the common country boats, are at once annihilated.
The pilot may possibly expect some return
for his good offices; but, if he likes his
company, will, in all probability, set them
ashore at Calcutta free of all expence.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should not envy the purser his trip in a
chokey-boat, with no other than a very small
semi-circular covering of mats, under which it
is impossible to sit upright, except exactly under
its centre. In tempestuous seasons, and such
are generally the periods in which the Indiamen
arrive, there is often a high swell between
Kedgeree and Fulta, the river being in some
parts from three to six miles across, and running
to the southward, from which quarter the wind
blows very forcibly for five months at least.
Therefore, although so very few accidents happen,
it cannot be considered as a safe voyage
between the ship and the capital. The chokey-boats
are all under the master-attendant, and
bear the Company’s colors, on a small staff, or,
at times, at the head of the mast, made of a
single bamboo, nearly as long as the boat; which
ordinarily rows ten or twelve oars. Being of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>light construction, and divested of all superfluous
apparatus, the chokey-boats proceed at a prodigious
rate; and, on emergency, even when
opposed by the tide, can gain from two to six
miles hourly; according as they may be able to
row along the slack water; to pole up against
the more rapid streams; or to track up, when
both wind and tide are strongly adverse.</p>

<p class='c008'>When relatives, or particular friends, are on
board any ship whose arrival is expected, it is customary
to send a stout pinnace-budgrow to meet
her at Kedgeree, there to receive the persons for
whose accommodation it was provided. When
this act of kindness takes place, all the necessary
provision, a bed, table, chairs, &amp;c. are put on
board, together with a proper number of servants
of such description as are generally needful
on the water. Few who have any feeling for
their noviciate companions on board, especially
those who have been in India, quit the ship
without taking with them as many as the pinnace
can, without distressing all, receive. This
wind-fall does not happen every day; though
few ships return to India without conveying one
or more old standards, either civil or military:
but it is not always that notice can be received
of a ship’s being about to import; and when
such notice has been received, it is not always
thought of, or perhaps practicable, to send a
pinnace to receive an old friend.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Persons in a delicate state of health should,
if possible, wait till some safe and comfortable
conveyance can be obtained. The most certain
mode is, to commission the purser to hire a
vessel the moment he reaches Calcutta, and to
send her off under charge of some servant, who
should see that no delay were made by the boatmen;
which, if paid by the day, would inevitably
follow. The misfortune is, that very few
can endure to be confined so much longer on
board, and often impatiently reject such a proposition:
here we may expect to find that the
greatest haste makes the worst speed; at the
same time that the expences are encreased
greatly, while the accommodations are deteriorated
in exact ratio.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now and then, an adventurous manjee, (or
boat-master,) who knows how to make a good
bargain, will linger about Diamond Harbour,
or lay up in Culpee Creek, with the intent of
going down, wind and tide permitting, to the
first ship which may arrive from Europe. Such
men are certain of a good fare, it being very
common to give from fifty rupees (about six
guineas) to one hundred (about twelve guineas)
for the trip. Such an opportunity, however extravagant
the terms may appear, ought not to
be lost; it being a great chance whether a
second vessel of the same description may proceed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>to the ship. As to small boats, rowing
four or six oars, and having either a thatched
cabin, or a semi-circular awning of mats,
several of them may come along-side; but
they will not be found to yield the smallest
accommodation beyond shelter from the sun;
while their manjees will not fail to take every
advantage of whatever distress, or difficulty, the
passenger may labor under.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would not be just to infer, from what I
have said, respecting the readiness with which
the boatmen avail themselves of the necessities of
persons desirous to leave a ship, that they are
particularly covetous, or prone to imposition:
we need only look at home, where we shall find
that no mercy is shewn to such unfortunate
persons as become the prey of our watermen,
along the whole extent of our coast. See with
what hard-hearted, callous apathy, the boatman
views the distress of the unthinking youth,
who, either by neglect, or by accident, remains
on shore after the boats that frequent his own
ship, then under weigh, have put off! What
prayers, or arguments, short of those issuing
from the purse, can urge him to relieve the
anxiety of him, whose whole hope, whose only
resource, lies in that voyage for which every
preparation has been made, and for which expences,
often nearly ruinous to friends and connections,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>have been defrayed! I speak not of
those who are in a hurry to quit their ships,
before coming to an anchor; if they will have
their way, they must pay for such intemperate
haste; it is an expence they have the option of
avoiding.</p>

<p class='c008'>Really, when we come to a fair computation
of the risks attendant upon taking a vessel,
built expressly for accommodation, and not intended
to meet the rude surges of, what may be
called, an arm of the sea; that from twelve to
eighteen men are engaged; that much time is
lost in waiting arrivals; that full sixty miles are
to be passed over; and that, perhaps, four or
five gentlemen, with all their luggage that may
be at hand, are conveyed; I say, when all this
is considered, although we certainly, from habit
of having things cheaper in India, may deem
even the fifty rupees exorbitant, yet there appears
far less reason to find fault with the extortion
of the Indian than there is to condemn the
cruel rapacity of the English boatman!</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever may be the rate at which the boat,
supposing it to be a pinnace-budgrow, is engaged,
no apparatus of any description should be
expected; for none will be found. There will
usually be an open veranda in the front, having
three or four steps to descend from the deck
thereto; it being on the same level with the
front, or dining room. The after-room narrows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>considerably towards the stern; and, on account
of the vessel’s form, its floor is usually raised
one or two steps; this is the sleeping apartment:
at the stern is a small slip, serving for a quarter-gallery:
The roofs of these boats are usually
flat; and some have side-rails above to prevent
luggage, or those who sleep there, from falling
overboard. The sides are furnished, for their
whole length, with Venetian blinds, in frames
which lift up by means of hinges at their tops;
and a long curtain, made either of tarpaulin, or
of painted, or of white canvas, is nailed on
the outside; letting down at pleasure, to keep out
wind, rain, dust, &amp;c. The baling-place is ordinarily
about the centre of the front room; that
being the deepest part of the boat’s bottom.
Baggage may be put under the deck; but that
part is generally occupied by the dandies, (or
rowers,) if permitted to sleep there; or perhaps
the manjee may think it worth his while to
make it a trading voyage and lay in salt, rice,
&amp;c. to be disposed of to advantage on his arrival
at the presidency.</p>

<p class='c008'>From this concise detail it will be seen, that
some penance must be undergone, even in this
kind of boat, and supposing it to be perfectly
fitted up with the above defences against bad
weather: but such will rarely turn out to be the
case. The sea-cot is now of singular use; its
hooks being withdrawn from the ship’s beams,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>and inserted in those of the budgrow. Those
who had standing bed-places, must spread their
mattresses, &amp;c. on the floor: all must sit upon
their trunks, or whatever may be at hand; and
every little article of convenience brought from
the ship will become useful. Candles, candle-sticks,
tin-ware, glasses, &amp;c. are now invaluable.
As to table-cloths, there being no table,
they may be cheerfully dispensed with; as may
also knives and forks, there being no plates;
it being probable that curry and rice, prepared
by the boatmen, will form the bill of fare.
Those who are fond of savoury dishes, may, in
this instance, gratify themselves with a repast
in high estimation among the gentlemen of
India: viz. a dandy’s curry; but I fear, that
those who have been in the habit of eating made
dishes, at a distance from the culinary operations,
may not altogether relish the manner of
preparation, nor be invariably pleased with the
appearance of the cook; whose habiliments will
probably consist of a cloth wrapped round his
waist, then passed between his thighs, and a
small cap, if the party be a Mussulman; if
a Hindu, the entire dress may be composed of
a small cord tied round his waist for the purpose
of supporting a narrow piece of cloth passed
between his thighs thus barely answering
the purpose of a fig-leaf. Herpetic eruptions,
in large patches, all over the back, breast and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>arms, together with obvious symptoms of a more
troublesome cutaneous complaint, about the
fingers, &amp;c. are by no means rare, yet never
disqualify the scratching sufferer from officiating
as cook to the crew! Were such <em>trifles</em> to
be objectionable, it might be somewhat difficult
to get a dinner dressed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being utterly impracticable to row a budgrow
against the tide, which ordinarily runs
from three to six miles in the hour, and many
difficulties presenting themselves to render it
by no means easy to track along the shore, especially
where the mud-banks shelve out a great
way, the manjee will probably come to near
some village, or in some creek, during the ebb;
and, as it rarely happens that the first of the
flood is taken, particularly during the night
time, in all probability the best part of three
days will be expended between Kedgeree and
Calcutta. If a few bottles of wine, a small
quantity of biscuit, a piece of beef, or of pork,
and a pack of cards, have been supplied from
the ship, so much the more agreeably will the
time be passed; but I cannot forbear from observing,
that intemperance at this time rarely
fails to bring on fevers, such as baffle the art
of man. Those who heat their blood on first
entering the country, whether by drinking, or by
exposure to the sun, become subject to diseases
of the liver which are too often incurable, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>finally, though after some years perhaps, drag
their lingering victim to the grave. With respect
to bathing, it is not only insalubrious, as
practised by persons who have not proper apparatus
at hand, but highly dangerous, on account
of the incredible numbers of alligators and
sharks, which infest not only the great river,
but every little creek, and puddle, within reach
of the tide.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manjee generally endeavors to reach
Culpee, Fultah, or Diamond Harbour, with
the first tide: at either of those places many
articles of provision may be had, and there will
be found some persons who can speak a little
English. These will invariably do all in their
power to encourage the purchase of many things
of no use whatever, but which become perquisites
to the manjee, on his passengers quitting
the vessel. Abundance of poultry may be seen;
but, with the exception of a curry, there will
no method of dressing them; unless accidentally
some person be on board, in whatever capacity,
who can trim a fowl, and roast it. If
fish are to be had, they will come under the
same difficulty; so that, like Sancho, in the
midst of plenty, a man may be next to starving,
if he cannot make up his mind to partake of the
dandies’ curry.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is proper to caution against eating much
fruit, though it may be perfectly ripe: unseasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>avidity in this way has proved fatal to
many on their arrival. A few bananas will not
incommode; but the cocoa-nut, however pleasant
and refreshing it may be, should be partaken
of very sparingly; it being extremely apt
to affect the bowels, as is also the jack.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have never had an opportunity of
seeing the fire-fly, will be agreeably surprized at
the millions of those little luminaries, which at
night bespangle every bush: displaying themselves
in the most vivid manner. The hind parts
of these insects, which may be about the size of
common house-flies, are replete with a brilliant
substance, similar to that contained in the glow-worm,
and, like it, equally innocent. It is extremely
curious, that, in many parts of the ocean,
immense shoals of the luminous sea-maggot,
each about the size of a man’s finger, should be
seen at nights, causing the water to assume a
phosphoric appearance. In sailing through these
living shoals, abundance may be drawn up in
buckets; while, at the same time, innumerable
fishes of prey may be heard, or seen, rushing
among them, and, no doubt, making many a
hearty meal. The great distance from all land at
which these shoals are to be found, must cause
us to wonder at their origin, and at their future
purposes; for we can scarcely suppose them to
be derived from terrestrial parents; nor is it very
easy to reconcile to ourselves, that they change
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>into fishes of any kind. It should rather seem
that all-bountiful Providence has created them
for the sole purpose of affording sustenance to
those fishes, which, in consequence of their remaining,
perhaps altogether, remote from every
shore, would, but for these <em>larvæ</em>, (as we must,
for want of knowing better, call them,) be unable
to subsist.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons arriving from Europe, rarely have any
but British coins; in the disbursing of which
many impositions will be practised. The best
mode is to tender the whole, without delay, to
some of the English agency houses, who will
readily pay their full value; it being often a
matter of difficulty to obtain a few guineas for
their friends who may be about to embark, without
paying an exorbitant sum to the <em>shroff’s</em>, or
native bankers, who can acquire them only from
such persons as import with the Indiamen, and
are rarely acquainted with their real value.</p>

<p class='c008'>Accounts are generally kept in current rupees,
which are considered, (though in themselves
nominal, there being no such coin,) the standard
to which all other denominations of money should
be reduced: this is, in fact, the application of
one term, whereby all others are to be appreciated.
It is often found useful to have a second
column, in every folio, wherein to note the corresponding
amounts in sicca rupees, they being
in general use. The infinite variety, both of gold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>mohurs, and of rupees, renders it highly necessary
for the young adventurer to be careful, lest
he should receive such as are of inferior value;
a trick extremely common among servants, as
well as <em>shroffs</em>, <em>sircars</em>, and shop-keepers; all of
whom will exercise their cunning to obtain the
smallest advantage, and derive peculiar satisfaction
from involving the matter in as much confusion
as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Calcutta seer is fixed at eighty sicca rupees
weight; the factors’ maund, of the same
place, amounts to one-tenth less, on account of
its having but seventy-two siccas to its seer. In
the upper provinces, even the neighbouring villages
often vary to a great extent; some seers
being only sixty-four pice, while others are
ninety-six; the pice and the sicca rupee being
nearly of a weight. Nor is the value of a pice,
which is a copper coin, less uncertain; on some
days they are at sixty to a rupee, at other times,
as high as sixty-five or sixty-six; just as may
happen to suit the <em>shroffs</em>, who, by this fluctuation,
create a kind of stock-jobbing traffic;
whereby they rob the public as much, and as
often, as they please; no one interfering to control
this nefarious and unparalleled insolence!</p>

<p class='c008'>The following varieties regarding the <em>guz</em> should
be understood; they being what formerly were
in use, and upon which many details of ancient
occurrences and measurements depend.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The <em>guz-soudah</em>, 24⅔ of a finger, as measured
by Haroon Resheed from the hand of one of his
slaves. This was the basis of the nilometer, and
of the yard for measuring cloths. The <em>guz-me-sahet</em>
measured twenty-eight fingers, and that of
Humaion thirty-two: the latter was used by
order of Sheer Khan, and Selim Khan, for the
measurement of cultivated lands. Akber also
allowed a <em>guz</em> of forty-six fingers to be used for
cloth only, and one measuring forty-two <em>isecunderees</em>,
(small coins of base silver,) to be used for
other purposes. This is called the <em>secundry-guz</em>.
A <em>coss</em> is generally accepted at two English miles,
and will, for the most part, be found to come
within a mere trifle of that measurement. In
some places, they reckon by the <em>puckah</em>, or long
coss; in others, by the <em>ghow-coss</em>, which alludes
to that distance the lowing of cattle may
be heard: this is also called the <em>cutcha-coss</em>;
meaning imperfect, or short. The fact is, that
the length of a coss is perfectly undefined by any
proper standard, or explanation. What else, indeed,
can be expected in a country where there
are neither public roads, nor inns, public conveyances,
nor even mile stones, or directing posts,
on the most practised routes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among other salutary and useful, but unfortunately
temporary, regulations, the Emperor
Akber fixed the coss at 5000 guz, equal to 4757
yards, or two miles, five furlongs, of our standard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Shah Jehan afterwards encreased it, by the
addition of one furlong; but both their measurements
gradually fell into disuse, and the old nominal
coss of Hindostan again came into vogue.
Including all the variations, however, in what
are called puckah-cosses there appear less anomalies
than might be expected in a range of 1700
miles, throughout which no determinate law, on
that subject, obtains. Computing by horizontal
measurements, between places whose distances
are accurately known, it appears that the coss
may be taken at a mile and nine-tenths: in this,
one mile in seven is thrown into the computation,
to account against the winding of roads.
In the Malwa country, the cosses are about an
eighth longer than in the Company’s dominions
towards that quarter; while, in the vicinity of
Masulipatam they are in the same proportion
shorter. The goondy coss of the Nagpore district,
is about three miles. Perhaps the most
absurd mode of ascertaining the length of a coss,
which, by the by, must be a very short one, and,
according to the statement of Abu Fazil, was
practised among the Hindus, depended on ‘One
thousand steps taken by a woman bearing a
child’ (of what age is not specified) ‘in her
arms, and a jar of water’, (also indefinite as to
bulk,) ‘on her head!’ Again, ‘the distance a
man could go, at a quick pace, without being
out of breath’, was accounted a coss! Others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>determined that measurement by ‘plucking a
green leaf, and bearing it on their heads until it
became dry!’</p>

<p class='c008'>The most rational, and simple mode of adjustment,
appears to be that ordered by Sheer Khan,
viz. sixty <em>jereebs</em> of sixty <em>guz</em> each. This would
be about 3500 yards; being only twenty less
than two statute miles. Whenever the emperor
marched with his armies, persons were appointed
to measure his route, by means of bamboos cut
to the length of twelve and a half <em>ilahi-guz</em>; four
hundred bamboos being accounted a coss;
which, as already specified, amounted to two
miles and five furlongs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the peasantry, other beegahs are in use,
viz. one which has an area of 3600 <em>ilahi-guz</em>,
equal to 3025 square yards; but, in general,
the <em>dessy-bigah</em> of only 1600 square yards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>prevails. This <em>ilahi-guz</em> is divided into twenty-four
tesuj, each of which, in the long <em>guz</em>
should be equal to the breadth of eight ordinary
barley corns; but in the short <em>guz</em>, only
of six. The former was used in great works;
the latter in small ones, such as manufactures,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>All goods being landed under the inspection
of custom-house officers, the passenger will
have little opportunity of interfering in regard to
his baggage, or merchandize. Nor should I recommend
his attempting, personally, to transact
any business before he may have delivered his
letters of credit, or of introduction. That should
be his first step; both because it will be the
means of managing all his concerns with facility,
and, probably, of being comfortably situated,
without having occasion to resort to a tavern.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here I deem it an indispensable duty, to warn
the young adventurer not to dissipate his money,
ruin his health, and injure his reputation, by
frequenting taverns. In England, where persons
who do not keep house must occasionally
sit down to a meal in public, custom has not
only connived at, but sanctioned, the resort to
coffee-houses, &amp;c. With us, these afford convenience
to thousands, who could never provide
so comfortably at home, at the same expence.
The coffee-houses in Europe may likewise be
considered as the rendezvous of persons in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>same line of business, and offering the opportunity
for adjusting a thousand matters, which,
either owing to remote residence, or to the pressure
of other concerns, could not else be brought
to immediate conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The taverns in India are upon a very different
plan: they are either of the first rate, at which
public dinners are occasionally given; or they
are of that mean description which receive all
who have a rupee to spend, under the determination
of extracting that rupee, in some shape
or other. The former class is very confined in
numbers, but the latter are abundantly numerous,
and may be readily distinguished by the
promiscuous company, the shabbiness of the
treatment, and the excess of imposition practised,
especially on novices. It is extremely easy to
avoid the necessity for running into the mouths
of these leviathans: all that is requisite, being
merely to call at the first office, or shop, and to
enquire for the residence of the gentleman to
whom the letter of introduction may be addressed.
No ceremony should be used in explaining
the circumstances, and in soliciting the aid of a
servant to lead the way. I never yet heard of a
want of civility on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>In speaking thus confidently regarding a letter
of introduction, I am pre-supposing, that the
case alludes to a person not appointed to the
service of the Company: for I cannot conceive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>what could induce any man of respectability to
visit India, without some substantial recommendation,
or, indeed, unless under some agreement,
or sufficient assurance of being employed
in such manner as might tend to certain advantage.
Nothing can be more forlorn than the
situation of a mere adventurer, on his arrival in
India! With money in his pocket, he may assuredly
subsist; but, without some friend to
introduce him into society, he may remain for
years without being noticed; for, throughout
the East, and especially at the several presidencies,
he who knows nobody, him will nobody
know! Residence at a tavern, is, in itself, a
perfect disqualification among persons of repute;
as implying either an addiction to liquor, or a
predilection for low company.</p>

<p class='c008'>In saying this, I must not be understood as
denying, that some worthy characters have been
rescued from perpetual degradation, by accidental
intercourse with persons of peculiar sensibility:
but such nice feelings, and that unqualified
liberality, which may have been occasionally
discovered in a few individuals, are rarely
united; and, when they are, it too often happens
that the power to render them effectively
beneficial is altogether wanting. A man may be
thoroughly convinced of the worthiness of his
protegé, but it will not always follow that society
will join him in opinion. In considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the state of society in India, this will be evident:
its being strongly inculcated will prove serviceable
to many, who may have mis-conceived the
subject in general: or who may have been led,
by a too sanguine disposition, to deem the
whole toil, risk, and solicitude as being over, so
soon as their feet can rest on the terra firma
of Hindostan.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ordinary mode in which an European is
attacked, on his first arrival at Calcutta, is by
the tender of a bearer, carrying a large umbrella,
to shelter master from the sun, or rain. There
is something about a stranger, in that quarter,
which instantly announces him to all the predatory
tribe, who wait at the wharfs in expectation
of living booty: but, if such were not the
case, his total ignorance of the language would
be sufficient to determine their conduct. The
bearer, who is in league with that numerous
horde of miscreants called <em>sircars</em>, abounding,
not only at Calcutta, but throughout the lower
provinces, speedily conveys the hint to his associates,
when a smooth-faced chap, who speaks
English well enough to be understood, and who
comprehends more than he will acknowledge,
advances, and making a respectful obeisance,
called a <em>salaam</em>, by bending his head downwards,
and placing the palm of his right hand to his
forehead, makes an offer of his services to the
stray Briton.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>However prepared a youth may be, by all the
cautious injunctions of friends, and by the detail
of knaveries practised by such characters, still it
is by no means easy to avoid the snare! When
we reflect on the anxiety inseparably attendant
upon arrival in a country where every thing is
new, every thing strange, and where, in case of
disappointment, all must be misery; it should
not surprize us to find so much dependence
placed on those who cheer the novice, by speaking
to him in his native tongue. But, admitting
the folly of confiding in any stranger, how is the
case to be ameliorated? Ignorant of the language,
as well as of the customs; totally unacquainted
with any soul on the spot; and eager to obtain a
shelter from the oppressive heats; what is the
poor adventurer to do? He cannot remain in
the boat! He cannot take root, and vegetate,
at the water side! Nor can he perambulate the
public roads, until fatigue shall sink him to the
dust, or some benevolent, and inspired European
may, on perceiving his distress, offer him
an asylum! What then is to be done?—Why,
the <em>sircar</em> must lead him to some paltry tavern,
in which he either is interested, or from whose
keeper he receives a douceur for introducing the
guest. In the mean time, his baggage, with the
exception of such minutiæ as may adhere to the
fingers of the boat-men, or of those who have the
handling of them on shore, will follow, and there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>will be no want of attention to immediate accommodation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tavern-keeper, under the plausible pretext
of aiding towards the completion of the youth’s
wishes, never fails to enquire whether the gentleman
has any friends in town? or even in the
country? If affirmatively answered, ‘mine host’
feels himself tolerably secure of his money: but
will probably assert, that the friend in town is
out of the way, and will not be back for some
days: should the gentleman be totally destitute
of friends, then comes the rich harvest. Imposition
following imposition, swell the bill; which,
if appearances warrant forbearance, is kept back
as long as possible, under the pleasing assurance
of perfect confidence: but, in the end, a catalogue
of items is produced, which never fails to
alarm, if not to ruin, the unsuspecting victim!</p>

<p class='c008'>If, unhappily, the guest should so far lower
himself as to associate with the ordinary company
of the common drinking-room, he is irretrievably
gone. Quarrels, riots, and inebriety,
must follow; in all probability rendering him
subject to the notice of the police. Should
his face ever be seen at that office, it would be
next to impossible that he should be admitted
into any respectable circle. What with lodging,
dinners, wines, &amp;c. of the worst description,
but all rated at the highest prices, he must be a
fortunate wight who escapes under a gold mohur
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>(<i>i.e.</i> two guineas) per day: in general, double
that sum is charged; so that a person starts at
the rate of £1000. per annum, at least; while,
in all probability no established, or even apparent,
provision exists, whereby he may be maintained.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we add the allurements held out by the
sable beauties, who will contrive means to retail
their charms so long as they think money is to
be had, we shall find no trifling expence incurred.
This latter part of the ceremony is usually
performed by some fellow who can speak English,
and thoroughly understands whatever relates to
the interest of the concern; which, among other
things, includes thieving, lying, cheating, pimping,
&amp;c. This first essay is ordinarily made by
describing the elegance of the native women,
and their great perfection as singers, and dancers;
and rarely fails, especially with youths under
such circumstances, to excite something more
than curiosity. The dancing-girls are introduced,
and consequences follow, over which I shall
draw the veil; simply observing, that nothing
can be more dangerous than this irregular indulgence;
it never failing, first to drain the
purse, and, in a few days, or weeks, the constitution
also.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those servants who usually ply at the wharfs,
and endeavor to obtain employment, either
among the officers of ships, or among persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>fresh from Europe, for the most part speak
broken English with sufficient fluency: this
renders them particularly serviceable to both
those classes, by enabling them to provide, and
to act, when, without such assistance, they
would be in distress, and at a stand. It is a
very general custom among the Mussulmans of
low condition, to give such of their male
children as are born during their Lent, (or <em>Ramzaun</em>,)
the name of <em>Ramzauny</em>: meaning ‘born
during the <em>Ramzaun</em>.’ There being so many
thus designated, renders the name extremely
common; and, as an infinity of rogueries have
been practised by persons so called, it has rather
got into disgrace. Hence, the adventurers above
described are, by a slight, but ludicrous corruption,
termed <em>Rum-Johnnies</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>That a servant thus enabled to act as the medium
of intercourse, must prove on many occasions
highly convenient, may be confessed; but,
like a double-edged sword, he may operate either
way, as to himself may appear expedient; and
while pretending to serve, may be pillaging his
employer. It is to be lamented, that the
stranger has no immediate resource; and, in
case of injury, little redress. The mischief is
not owing to any deficiency in the police, but
arises from that invariable precaution with which
<em>Rum-Johnnies</em> carry on their manœuvres: they
never fail to have a third person in the way, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>is to disappear with the purloined articles, and
to bear all the blame; while the principal affects
great resentment at the <a id='corr168.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='villian’s'>villain’s</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.3'><ins class='correction' title='villian’s'>villain’s</ins></a></span> audacity, and
sorrow for master’s loss. This is often so dexterously
managed as to occasion serious quarrels,
when friends, who see through the deception,
endeavor to convince the infatuated party, that
his confidential menial is at the bottom of the
roguery. The disreputable circumstance of having
a thief at his elbow, does not sit very easy
on the stranger’s mind: deriving so much convenience
from <em>Rum-Johnny’s</em> aid, and, having
only the fair side of the knave’s conduct in view,
he is unwilling to give credit to what appears a
gross misrepresentation, founded on <a id='corr168.15'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='perjudice'>prejudice</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_168.15'><ins class='correction' title='perjudice'>prejudice</ins></a></span>.
By this means, he sinks deeper into the mire, and
renders it dangerous for his well-wisher to attempt
his extrication.</p>

<p class='c008'>I recollect an instance of a young gentleman’s
joining a regiment, about a hundred miles
up the country, who had among his servants
a <em>khedmutgar</em>, (or table-attendant,) of whom
I never could get a sight. The fellow was always
sick, or busy; or some excuse was invariably
made. At length, one of my own domestics
informed me, that he was a <em>Rum-Johnny</em>
who had been discharged from my service, in
which he held the office of <em>mosaulchy</em>, (or link-boy,)
for theft. I found out, that he had been
employed in the barracks at Fort-William, where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>he picked up a little English, and had fastened
upon the gentleman, no doubt with the intention
to avail himself of the first good prize wherewith
to decamp. Finding, to his great discomfiture,
that I had been removed to that station, where
he found me, the scoundrel kept aloof, under the
hope of carrying his project into execution.
Strange to say, it was with extreme difficulty I
could convince my young friend that he was the
dupe of a downright thief; who, if I had not
been improperly lenient, would have had the certificate
of his crime noted on his back, by the
drummers of the regiment!</p>

<p class='c008'>To state the evil, without pointing out the
remedy, would be next to useless: but, when I
suggest the means of avoiding those difficulties,
or any portion of them, attendant on arrival in
a foreign land, it must be understood, that I consider
the stranger to be possessed of pecuniary
means: that is, that he can pay his way. Without
this, he can do nothing; and must undergo
all the afflictions and miseries attendant upon
despised poverty, in every part of the globe. It
may be proper to point out in this place, that
what might here appear to be liberal calculations,
will not suit the East; where every article of
European manufacture bears so enormous a price,
where house-rent is so expensive, and where it
is indispensably necessary to retain so many servants.
The first thing to be done, (setting a letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>of recommendation out of the question,)
should be to report arrival at the secretary’s office,
depositing the certificate of the Court of
Directors’ licence to proceed to India; without
which, the party is treated as an alien, and
scarcely considered entitled to British protection.
This does not arise from ill-will on the part of
government, or of the inhabitants; but from that
strict attention the politics of the country imperiously
demand to be paid to the several characters,
and descriptions, of persons residing within
our territory.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above relates equally to all persons in the
civil or military branches; the certificate granted
at the India House must be produced, in order
to identify the party; but if it should have been
lost, he himself, together with the commander
who received the order to take him on board,
must attend, to make affadavit to that effect, before
the appointment can be admitted upon the
registers in India.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as appertain to the civil service, being
always strongly recommended and often finding
many old acquaintances of their families on
the spot, require but little advice; nor does the
cadet stand much in need of instruction, as to
the manner in which he should provide himself
with a home. All he has to do is to wait upon
the town-major, at his office in Fort-William,
when he will receive the necessary order for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>his admission into the Cadet Corps, at Baraset,
about sixteen miles from Calcutta.</p>

<p class='c008'>He who has not these advantages, must do the
best his circumstances may afford; he will find
temperance to be not only cheap, but indispensable;
for, if he should act so indiscreetly at the
outset as to injure his health, a thousand privations,
and a certain encrease of difficulties, must
follow. The first point must necessarily be to
get under cover. This will not be found so easy,
as those who have never quitted England may
suppose. It will be after much research, that
a small house will be had, and then only the bare
walls; for no such thing is known in India as a
furnished house to be let; and lodgings are, if
possible, still more out of the question. Fortunately,
there are, among the European shop-keepers
in Calcutta, some most respectable characters;
men distinguished for their urbanity,
philanthropy, and generosity. Application should
be instantly made to one of these firms, for aid,
and advice. The case should be candidly stated;
and, in order to insure confidence, a deposit of
money should be made, either with them, or at
one of the Banks. The consequences will be,
that, in a few hours, some small tenement will
be obtained, either on hire, or granted as a temporary
accommodation, and the whole of the
articles really necessary will be provided, at some
one or other of the auctions which daily take
place within the central parts of the town.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>The appointment of proper servants will be a
matter of importance; but, under the auspices of
any old resident, by no means difficult; such will
be not simply the most expeditious, but the safest,
way of proceeding; since those who recommend
will, in all probability, be expected, according to
the custom of the place, to become sureties for
the honesty of all persons hired through their
means. One servant who can speak English, or
at least, an underling <em>sircar</em>, deputed from the
warehouse, will prove a very agreeable resource,
on all occasions of difficulty; but I cannot too
forcibly inculcate the good policy, or rather the
absolute necessity, of immediately studying the
language: till that is acquired, to such an extent
as may remove the necessity for an interpreter
on ordinary occasions, no person can be deemed
independent; far less, capable of acting in any
civil, military, or commercial capacity, with effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strange to say I have known gentlemen to be
resident from ten, to thirty, years in India, without
being able to summon resolution to acquire
sufficient of the Hindui language even to take
their accounts! With such the <em>sircar</em> was every
thing. The consequences were, invariably, that
he was rich, and master ever in distress!</p>

<p class='c008'>Without pretending to make a very accurate
estimate, I shall attempt to give an outline of
those expences to which every person keeping
house, though in the most retired manner, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>on the most economical plan, must be subjected.
In doing this, I consider the instructions
given for the outfit to have been duly attended
to; and, that wearing apparel, plate,
bedding, blankets, sheets, and pillow cases, have
been provided. If they have not, the whole of
those articles may be rated at from fifty to a
hundred per cent. more than they would cost
in England. The following brief catalogue will
be found to contain only those conveniences
which are indispensable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>In this I have not included a horse, because
it is not every body who keeps one, nor is it
peremptorily needful; but, both as a convenience,
and as tending to health, I recommend
that a cheap, safe, and quiet poney be provided:
numbers are sold every week, at all prices; but
I should think that, including the saddle and
bridle, from 250 to 300 rupees, would be going
far enough: say the whole expence should be
1000 sicca rupees, or £125; which will, I apprehend,
be as little as any person can expend,
so as to be either creditable or comfortable.
The necessary stock of wines, spirits, wax-candles,
sauces, sugar-candy, tea, coffee, salt-petre,
and a number of lesser items, would require
full 600 rupees more; under the supposition
that a year’s stock were laid in. At that
rate we may compute £200. to be necessary to
establish a gentleman at his residence, supposing
it to be fixed. Travelling makes quite another
concern, and will be found to encrease the disbursements
considerably.</p>

<p class='c008'>A comparison with the prices of those articles
we, in Europe, consider to be requisite for
the furniture of two or three rooms, will shew
that Calcutta is by no means a favourable market
for the purchase, either of furniture, or of wines,
cattle, &amp;c.; and should at once satisfy every
free-mariner, free-merchant, &amp;c. proceeding to
India on speculation, that he must be provided
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>with at least six hundred pounds to answer the
demands of his outset, including house rent,
which cannot well be taken at less than £150.
per annum; his servants will amount to about
as much more; and his table expences, pocket-money,
&amp;c., on the most moderate scale, will
demand one hundred, after laying in his stock
of wines, tea, &amp;c. So that, in all, we may
think he does very well on the £600. If,
indeed, he should be so fortunate as to make
numerous respectable acquaintances, at whose
tables he may frequently become a guest, a considerable
portion of the expences, stated at
£100. may, perhaps, be retrenched; but such
good fortune does not happen to all; and, when
it does, rarely comes at once; it requires some
time to gain that footing which may relieve the
pressure of table charges; and when that footing
has been gained, it may not be attended with
more than common civility, without the smallest
prospect of being served.</p>

<p class='c008'>I say thus much with the view to correct an
opinion known to prevail, that it is easy to get
into society in India; and that then a gentleman
may put his hands in his pockets, while his
friends forward him rapidly. Such, assuredly,
was the case in days of yore; but, within the
last twenty years, there have been so many retrenchments
in all the public offices, so many
young men have gone to India with the hope of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>being engaged in merchants’ houses, and so
many have failed in those prospects, that I
should omit a very important branch of that duty
I have imposed on myself, in offering my advice
to those who are about to proceed to India, were
I to encourage the idea of such supposed facilities
being realized. It should never be forgotten,
that all persons who are ignorant of the
language spoken in common, namely, the Hindui,
(vulgarly called the <em>Moors’</em>,) are incompetent
to any duty, beyond what may relate to
making out copies of accounts-current, and
registering correspondence: even these demand
some local knowledge, to be performed
with correctness. This consideration will lead
to the conviction, that full one year must be
provided for before any employment, on which
dependance can be placed for a livelihood, and
affording the prospect of future rise, should be
expected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of such importance does this appear, that,
were I to advice any young friend, about to proceed
to India, as to the manner in which he
should pass his first year, it would be nearly in
the following terms: ‘Rise at daybreak, and
ride gently for one hour in the hot season, and
two hours in the cold season; make a moderate
breakfast, avoiding melted butter, salt meats,
salt fish, sweetmeats, &amp;c., good tea or coffee
being assuredly the most wholesome; study the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>language for an hour; attend some office gratuitously,
with the view to become acquainted with
the accounts, price-currents, markets, provisions,
commodities, &amp;c.; about two o’clock retire
to rest; about an hour before sun-set bathe,
by means of three or four large pots of water
poured over the head; put on clean linen, and
dine moderately upon plain viands, taking care
never to exceed four or five glasses of the best
Madeira; proceed for two hours with studying
the language, and, after taking a cup or two of
tea, or of coffee, or a crust of bread and a glass
of Madeira, go to bed, avoiding to sleep in a
strong current of air.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Possibly, it may be urged, that a person intent
on learning the Hindui, so as to be competent
to transact business in the course of
twelve months, would not attain that object by
three hours only of daily assiduity. I am, however,
completely satisfied, that such a portion
of time, appropriated under the guidance of an
intelligent linguist, may enable the student to
make a wonderful progress; especially when
combined with the resolution to enter as much
as possible into familiar colloquy in that language.</p>

<p class='c008'>An old friend, long since gone to ‘kingdom
come,’ began the study of Persian at rather an
advanced age; which caused many to rally him
on the new turn he had taken. He, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>persevered, and, in the course of two years,
made himself more than commonly proficient.
The explanation he gave, regarding the plan he
had laid down, was such as convinced me, that
any person, with a tolerable memory, may, in a
moderate time, acquire any regular language.
His mode was, for the first month never to retire to
bed until he had learned twenty words perfectly
by heart, so as to explain them with promptitude,
however catechized: after that first month,
he was master of no less than six hundred
words. During the next month, finding that
former acquirements greatly facilitated his progress,
he made a point of gaining twenty-five
words daily; therefore that month gave him
seven hundred and fifty words; which, added to
the six hundred of the preceding, made a total
of thirteen hundred and fifty.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this way he added <a id='corr178.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sic: five hundred words?'>five words</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_178.19'><ins class='correction' title='sic: five hundred words?'>five words</ins></a></span> every month,
until he found, that, by aid of derivations and
compounds, he was well grounded in the language.
His computation was, that, as few
languages contain more than forty thousand
words in common use, when ever he should be
able to learn fifty words daily, he might, to use
his own terms, ‘make the language fall before
him in two years.’</p>

<p class='c008'>This is an arithmetical demonstration of the
powers annexed to persevering regularity, and
ought to induce every youth, for that is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>season for acquirements, to adopt such a system
as should insure the great object in view. So
steady a mode of carrying on a pursuit, cannot,
however, be expected in young folks, many of
whom have just escaped from the trammels of
parental vigilance; and who, having passed so
many years at their studies, rarely feel much
disposition to prolong academic labors; while,
at the same time, the pleasures of society are
open to their participation. Still, I feel a hope
that this volume may prove intrinsically beneficial
to a large portion, by pointing out the
means whereby preferment may be obtained,
and by shewing with what facility the foundation
may be laid for a most superb superstructure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of servants, and the amount of
their wages, forming so conspicuous an item in
domestic economy, cannot fail to attract the attention,
not only of persons proceeding to India,
but of their parents, and friends, who often express
much surprize at the apparent extravagance of the
young <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>debutants</em></span> in this particular. Such notions
of improper indulgence in retinue, though perfectly
natural, as resulting from long habits, and
the little necessity felt among us in Europe, for
keeping many servants, even in large families,
by no means find a sanction when transplanted
beyond the narrow limits of our own island. In
many parts of Europe, custom has rendered permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>various practices which, no doubt, had
their origin in the purest motives, and did not,
in the first instance, appear likely to serve as
the basis of future excesses and encroachments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we find that, in Spain, no old servant is
ever discharged by any person of rank; in such
families the domestics of deceased parents are
invariably retained. The obvious consequence
is, that a young man, on coming to his title,
often finds himself burthened with some scores
of the aged, and of the idle; to discharge any
of which would be not only disgraceful, but
deemed illegal; they being considered as heirlooms,
by the rejection of which, the rest of
the inheritance would be virtually forfeited.
Here we see an excellent, and meritorious act,
converted into a nuisance, that proves highly
injurious, both to the interests of the successor,
and to the morals of the pensioners. But who
shall lead the way to break through so formidable
a phalanx!</p>

<p class='c008'>The multiplicity of menials employed in the
houses of European gentlemen in Bengal, results
from a cause very different from that above
described: it is founded on the tenets of religion,
especially among the Hindus; and is by
no means likely to be abrogated within our
time. What may be effected by a relaxation of
their present rigid principles, and by the further
extention of our customs, cannot be foretold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Our situation has ever been critical; now is
more so than ever; and we may be deprived of
the opportunity of judging what would have
resulted from the silent operations of succeeding
ages, by some sudden burst of revolt, occasioned
by the intrigues of petty rajahs within our
own territory; fomented by the animosity of
the native powers on our frontier, and by the
intrigues of French emissaries.</p>

<p class='c008'>It being my intention to treat separately of
the religious tenets, and institutions, both of the
Mussulmans and of the Hindus, little need be
said in this place, further than, that, owing to
the division of the latter into sects, called by us
<em>casts</em>, which render the occupations of all perfectly
distinct, a necessity exists for hiring such
of each <em>cast</em> as may attend to those duties
they undertake, without becoming subjected to
the animadversions of their priesthood, or to
those penalties attendant upon even the most
trifling deviation from the marked path. Add
to this, that the climate arbitrarily imposes the
necessity for retaining some classes of servants,
unknown in England; or, at least, supposed to
be exclusively attached to the convenience of
ladies, and of sick persons. When all matters
are considered, it will be found, that that host
of domestics appertaining to the establishment
of a gentleman in Bengal, proves, in the aggregate,
little, if at all, more expensive than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>ordinary number retained by families of respectability
in most parts of England. What with
wages, liveries, lodging, board, washing, waste,
negligence, and, I am sorry to say, pilfering,
we shall find the one man servant, and the two
maids, fully a match, in point of expence, with
the whole body of those in the pay of one of
our countrymen abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>A gentleman in this country never can guess at
the ultimate of his disbursements, where his domestics
are concerned either in the appropriation,
or in the expenditure: in Bengal, &amp;c. the uttermost
farthing is known; each servant receiving a
certain sum monthly, in consideration of which
he is in attendance during the whole day, finds
his own cloaths, provides his own victuals, and
pays for whatever cabin he may build or occupy.
As to purloining victuals, there is little
danger; for, with the exception of some of the
lower <em>casts</em>, which are held in a state of utter
abomination, no native of India, by which I
mean either Mussulman or Hindu, will so much
as touch those viands which an European has
partaken: or which have been served up
to his table.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this I must be understood to speak generally,
and without any reference to those few deviations
that have at times been discovered; being sensible,
that some instances could be adduced of servants,
particularly Mahomedans, having so far trespassed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>against the doctrines of their religion, as absolutely
to eat of <em>ham</em>, and other viands, in secret.
Such anomalies must be abstracted from
my main position; which is well known, by all
who have resided in India, to be perfectly correct.</p>

<p class='c008'>So strict are all the <em>casts</em>, however much the
one may be below the other in a religious point
of view, regarding the preservation of that conspicuous
distinction laid down by their sacred
code, that, notwithstanding they may worship
the same deities, under the same forms, and
with the same ceremonies, yet will they not
allow of participation at meals; nor even of
contact, at such moments. The stranger will,
no doubt, be greatly surprized on his arrival, to
see during the evenings, about sun-set, each
individual, or, perhaps, here and there, two or
three, if of the same <em>cast</em>, squatting on the
bare ground, within a small space levelled for
the purpose, of which the limits are marked
out by the line of dust, or rubbish, moved from
the centre towards the exterior. In such an area,
each man, or woman, cooks and afterwards eats,
the principal meal of the day. In fair weather,
these areas are made under the canopy of heaven;
but during the rainy season, and perhaps in winter
time, they are made within the huts of the
persons respectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>So extremely scrupulous are the natives, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>respect to the preparation of their victuals, and
to their consumption, that, if any person not of
the very same <em>cast</em>, with the reservation of the
brahmans, or priests, were to touch their bodies,
or their cloaths, or any one article within the
area, or even the surface of the area itself, the
whole meal, together with any earthen ware,
standing within the circumvallation, (if it may
be so called,) would be instantly thrown away,
as being polluted. Nay, whatever portion might
be in the mouth, must be ejected; and the party
be obliged to perform an ablution, before he could
attempt to resume his culinary labors, or to join
in society with his compeers. Nor will either a
Mussulman, or a Hindu, drink water out of any
vessel touched, while in a state of repletion,
by a person of inferior cast, or by an European.
Earthen ware of every kind, though new, or
empty, becomes defiled by such contact, so as to
be utterly useless to the proprietor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Knowing such to be the case, it must be both
cruel, and impolitic, to trespass on a prejudice
in itself perfectly innocent, and by no means interfering
with the rights, or the convenience, of
others. It is true, the patient Hindu, even
while suffering under those privations attendant
upon the destruction, or at least the disqualification,
of his meal, will rarely proceed to extremity
against any European, who may occasion
such an inconvenience and loss: because, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>a supposition of the trespasser’s ignorance, he,
in his mind, finds an excuse for, and pardons,
what he mildly terms ‘the accident.’ But,
should any native offend in a similar manner, a
war of words would exhibit the irritation of the
Hindu’s mind! Nor would he be passive were
one of his countrymen to step over him while
asleep; that being considered not only indelicate,
but productive of serious mischiefs; inducing
the visitations of evil spirits, thereby
causing disease, and, at no very remote period,
death. This strange infatuation must appear
perfectly ridiculous in any civilized being, but
especially among a race of people who are, one
and all, predestinarians. The European should
be careful not to stride over any of his domestics
who may occasionally lay down in the
veranda, &amp;c. of his house: such an act on
the part of an unbeliever, (applying the term to
ourselves,) being considered doubly laden with
mischief.</p>

<p class='c008'>The servants, whether of Europeans, or of
natives of consequence, are divided into two
classes. The first class, which is known by the
designation of <em>nokeron</em>, (plural of <em>noker</em>,) includes
such as, either from the important, or confidential,
offices they hold, are, in general estimation,
judged exempt from all menial duties.
They are as follow.</p>

    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c008'>Such is the superiority claimed by the <em>nokers</em>,
that, to ask one of them ‘whose <em>chauker</em> he is?’
would be considered a gross insult: the inferior
class are, on the other hand, very ready to assume
the former designation; holding it to be far more
respectable in the eyes of their countrymen;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>who comprehend, and value, that distinction,
which, among Europeans, is little attended to;
far the greater portion being, indeed, absolutely
ignorant of any reputed difference.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Banians</em> being, without doubt, the first in
fortune, as well as in rank, claim priority of description.
These are, invariably, Hindus, possessing
in general very large property, with most
extensive credit, and influence. So much is
this the case, that Calcutta was, some twenty
years ago, absolutely under the control of about
twenty or thirty <em>banians</em>, who managed every concern,
in which they could find means to make a
profit. It is inconceivable what property was in
their hands; they were the ostensible agents in
every line of business, placing their dependants
in the several departments over which themselves
had obtained dominion. Was a contract
to be made with government, by any gentleman
not in the Company’s service; these became the
securities, under the condition of receiving a
centage, and of appointing their friends to such
duties as might control the principal, and save
themselves from loss. When a person in the service
of the Company, was desirous of deriving benefit
from some contract, in the disposal of which
he had a vote, and which, consequently, he
could not obtain in his own name; then, the
<em>banian</em> became the principal, and the donor
either received a share, or derived advantage from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>loans, &amp;c. answering his purpose equally
well. The same person frequently was <em>banian</em>
to several European gentlemen; all of whose
concerns were, of course, accurately known to
him, and thus became the subject of conversation
at those meetings the <em>banians</em> of Calcutta
invariably held, and do yet hold, after the
active business of the day has been adjusted.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot, however, be denied, that many
speculations have been carried on by the aid of
<em>banians</em>, which, but for the strength of their resources,
could never have been attempted. We
owe our present extended trade in the fabrics of
Dacca, &amp;c. in the sugar of the western and northern
districts, in indigo throughout the country,
and numerous other branches of commerce, to
the support given by this class to such gentlemen
as appeared to them likely to succeed. It has
ever been a maxim among them, never to back
an unfortunate man; their opinion being, that
misfortunes in trade ordinarily arise from want
of management: if their own prosperity may be
adduced in support of that sentiment, it will be
found strongly to exhibit their policy of combining
with those who have not, on any occasion,
embarked on a rotten bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <em>banian</em> invariably rides in his palanquin,
attended by several underling <em>sircars</em>, <em>hirkarahs</em>,
&amp;c. He, to a certain degree, rules the office,
entering it generally with little ceremony, making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>a slight obeisance, and never divesting himself
of his slippers: a privilege which, in the
eyes of the natives, at once places him on a footing
of equality with his employer. Under such
a system, it has been easy for the tribe of
<em>banians</em> to effect the ruin of any individual; while
it was impossible for any man in distress to conceal
his circumstances, so as to obtain a loan, or
to extend his credit: hence, the courts of law
were full of causes in which <em>banians</em> were plaintiffs.
Of late years, the case has altered greatly;
for, if we except a few large concerns, such as
banking-houses, and the principal merchants,
who, having valuable cargoes on hand, are each
under the necessity of retaining one of this jew-like
gang, for the purpose of obtaining cash to
make up payments, or to advance for investments,
<em>banians</em> are become obsolete.</p>

<p class='c008'>In former times, there was little alternative
how money should be secured, except on mortgage,
or in the Company’s treasury; whereas,
few now think of lending money at less than
12 per cent., which is the legal interest; and,
as the Company do not receive loans at that rate,
except when pressed by exigency and, that
the great agency-houses continue to make such
an immense profit as enables them to pay so
high for money accommodation; the floating
property belonging to individuals, with little
exception, falls into their hands: consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>there is little occasion for <em>banians</em>; the principal
remains of whose extensive influence are to be
seen in the above concerns, and in the management
of elephant, bullock, or other contracts;
which they often buy of the contractor, either
for a specific sum paid down, or by allowing him
an annual contingent; so as to exempt him
from the responsibility, as well as from the
management, altogether.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall only add, that this description of persons
may be classed with the superior <em>debashes</em>
of the Carnatic; and that, although there certainly
have been found some individuals who
might fairly claim exemption from the accusation,
yet, that, generally speaking, the present
<em>banians</em>, who attach themselves to the captains
of European ships, may, without the least hazard
of controversion, be considered as nothing
more or less than <em>Rum-Johnnies</em> ‘of a larger
growth.’ Some of these gentry usurp the designation
of <em>dewan</em>, which should imply an extensive
delegated power; that office, under the
emperors of Hindustan, and even now in the
courts of Lucknow, Hydrabad, &amp;e. being confidential,
and never bestowed but on persons in
high favor.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Darogah</em>, or <em>Gomastah</em>, or factor, or superintendant
is an office rarely held under Europeans,
though extremely common in the services
of native princes, and of men of opulence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Some of our merchants appoint persons to attend
to their concerns in remote parts; such as the
timber-dealers in the Morungs; the iron-smelters
of various parts; the contractors for elephants,
camels, bullocks, horses, &amp;c. have also
their agents at the various stations. In general,
these are common <em>sircars</em>, who assume
the title of <em>darogah</em> by way of pre-eminence,
without any authority from, and often without
the knowledge of, their employers. The latter,
however, are rarely averse to such an assumption;
which, while it tickles their vanity, costs
not a farthing. The <em>darogahs</em>, or, I may rather
say, the <em>sircars</em>, frequently call themselves <em>naibs</em>,
or deputies: this should seem a more modest
term; but, among the natives, is considered
at least as consequential as the former; especially
when the principal never eclipses the
self-created dignitary, by personal attendance to
his own affairs in that quarter. Many of this
class are considered as approaching to menials.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Moonshy</em>, or linguist, is ordinarily a
teacher of some language, particularly the Persian
and Hindui: though numbers are employed
only as interpreters, or as scribes. Learning is
their sole pursuit; and so far as that can reach in
a country where but little is understood of philosophy
and mathematics, some of them do assuredly
advance themselves considerably. But,
speaking of them in general, it will be found,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>that a few volumes of tales, the lives of those
great men who have either invaded, or ruled,
the empire, some moral tracts, and the Koran,
(for <em>moonshies</em> are Mussulmans) constitute the acquirements
of this very haughty class of servants.
A <em>moonshy</em> is never so well pleased, as when
the payment of the domestic establishment is
confided to his charge. Here he is sure to touch
the penny, and to create an influence very injurious
to his employer’s interests: the whole tribe
of menials, considering him to have full command
of the whole concern, and viewing their master as
a mere cypher, dread the <em>moonshy’s</em> authority, and
crouch before him in the most submissive manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>banian</em> rarely receives wages, or any immediate
remuneration for his services; he knows
full well, that no money can pass the files on his
fingers without leaving some dust. The <em>darogah</em>
is sometimes paid by centage on the quantity of
goods he transmits, or on the amount of his
account; but the <em>moonshy</em> is ever in the receipt
of wages, which vary according to his own
talents and reputation, or to the rank of his employer.
Perhaps, a few may be found who receive
more, but two gold mohurs, (equal to four
guineas,) per month, may be taken as rather a
liberal, than an ordinary, rate. Some do not
receive more than eight or ten rupees; but,
whatever the learning of such men may amount
to, their conduct is generally influenced by motives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>wide from purity. Many of this class
might formerly be seen attached to those young
officers, and civil servants, who found an easy
mode of gratifying their ostentation by that display
of study they never realized, and who employed
these pretended tutors in all the drudgery
of expenditure; not forgetting those meaner offices,
which, while they disgraced themselves,
levelled all distinction between the man of letters
and the common pander!</p>

<p class='c008'>The private habits of <em>moonshies</em>, in general,
by no means correspond with the respectability
of their profession. Having only to attend
their employers at stated hours, and the
residue of their time being wholly unoccupied,
it is not to be wondered, that, with their
liberal salaries, they should rather court, than
shun, pleasure. Hence, with very few exceptions,
we find them extremely debauched
and unhealthy. What with venery, drinking,
smoking, &amp;c. nine in ten of them exhale the
most intolerable effluvia! This, by no means,
lowers their pride: on the contrary, they apparently
resort to arrogance, and to that precious
species of fastidious hauteur, ordinarily to be
found under the same sheep-skin with every
consummate hypocrite!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Jemmadar</em> is considered the most confidential,
and important, of all that class of servants
forming the retinue of a person of distinction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>The despatches, and consultations of
the various members of the council, are usually
conveyed by, or presented to, the several <em>jemmadars</em>,
in small boxes, of which each member
has a key. Some <em>jemmadars</em> are retained merely
with the view to superintend buildings, and commercial
operations; but such cannot be classed,
strictly speaking, with those who are merely state
servants; although the wages of each may be
nearly on a par; viz. from twelve to twenty rupees
monthly. This servant bears no insignia of
office, but, for the most part, studies to imitate
the appearance of a <em>moonshy</em> of a respectable
class; from which he may, however, be often
distinguished by the dagger, ornamented with gold
and tassels, or in a crimson velvet case, tipped
with gilt guards, worn in his <em>cummer-bund</em>, or
waist-cloth: whereas the <em>moonshy</em> never wears
any weapon whatever.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Chobe-dar</em>, or silver-pole bearer, is retained
only by persons of consequence; sometimes only
one, but usually two are employed, and even
four may be seen in the retinue of very exalted
characters. The pole, (or <em>chobe</em>,) may be about
four feet and a half in length, tapering gradually,
from the metal ferule at its base, to the top,
which may be about four inches in diameter, and
is generally embossed with some figure, such as
a tiger’s head, &amp;c.; while the rest, for the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>length, is of some pattern such as volutes, scales,
flowers, &amp;c. The pole consists of a staff, perhaps
three quarters of an inch in diameter,
spreading towards its top, so as to assimilate to
the form of the exterior case; which is of solid
wrought silver, often weighing 150 rupees or
more, into which, the staff being placed centrically,
melted rosin is poured to fill up the intermediate
space; the same as our plated knife handles
are done, thereby rendering the whole sufficiently
substantial, without adding too much to
the weight.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>chobe-dar</em> is generally a man of some prudence,
versed in all the ceremonies of court etiquette.
He stands at the inner door of the
audience, or receiving, apartment; announcing
the approach of visitors, and conducting them to
the presence. The <em>chobe</em> being in itself of some
value, and the office of considerable trust in
many instances, it is usual for this servant to
give adequate security, by means of creditable
persons who vouch for, and take upon themselves,
the actual responsibility regarding his conduct.
The wages of <em>chobe-dars</em> vary considerably, but
we may take from eight to twelve rupees as the
average. They attend early in the morning;
and, besides the above-noticed duty of announcing
visitors, run before the palanquins of their
employers, or, if there be no <em>jemmadar</em>, at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>sides, so as to receive orders without being called.
They likewise carry messages, or notes,
on formal occasions; especially to superiors.</p>

<p class='c008'>To this particular, great attention is paid; it
being considered, that the rank of the servant
bearing the message, or note, implies the degree
of respect the person sending would pay to the
person receiving. Thus, a message sent by a
<em>jemmadar</em>, is held to be more ceremonious,
than one by a <em>chobe-dar</em>; by a <em>chobe-dar</em> more
respectful than by a <em>soontah-burdar</em>; and by a
<em>soontah-burdar</em> than by a <em>peon</em>, or <em>hirkarah</em>. So
well is this understood, that, the precursors of a
great man always arrange themselves according
to the above rules; the <em>hirkarahs</em> and <em>peons</em> are
the foremost; next to them the <em>soontah-burdars</em>;
then the <em>chobe-dars</em>; and, lastly, the <em>jemmadar</em>;
the latter running at the side of the palanquin,
but being replaced during occasional absence by
a <em>chobe-dar</em>; and thus throughout. It must not
be forgotten, that, in India, the retinue precede
the employer: a custom by no means suited to
the climate, though perhaps gratifying to those
who take pleasure in seeing two lines of sweating
domestics preceding them; it need hardly be
urged, how unpleasant the clouds of dust raised
by them must be to the person seated in the
palanquin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dresses of the <em>jemmadar</em>, and of the
<em>chobe-dars</em>, may be considered the same; there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>being no characteristic difference, though the
former usually make their <em>jammas</em>, or robes,
which are always of white calico; unless where
colored broad-cloath may have been presented
to them for the purpose of making up liveries:
which, however, do not usually extend to this
class of messengers; white being considered
by themselves more dignified. Nor do they
feel any partiality for colored turbans, or waist-bands.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Soontah-burdar</em> bears a baton of about
thirty inches in length, generally curved at its
upper extremity, so as to resemble the ordinary
form of bludgeons. These batons are made of
the same materials as the <em>chobe</em>, or pole; but,
while the latter are borne, when their bearers
are proceeding with a palanquin, by a suitable
balance near their centres, like trailed arms, the
former are held by their lower extremities;
which, since they never are rested on the ground,
as the <em>chobes</em> are, require no ferules; the crooked
end of the <em>soontah</em> being carried over the
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Soontah-burdars</em> are frequently employed by
persons in a second or third rate of office, or of
opulence, where no <em>jemmadar</em>, nor <em>chobe-dar</em>, is
kept. As already explained, the absence of one
state-servant calls up the next in rank to supply
his place; a circumstance which by no means
impairs the dignity of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>locum tenens</em></span>. The pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>of this servant varies according to circumstances,
but may be from six to ten rupees monthly: the
dress differs from that of the superior class; it,
in most cases, being confined to a much shorter
<em>jamma</em>, reaching only to the knees, or but little
below them, and there being less objection to
wear colored turbans, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Kansamah</em> may be classed with the
house-steward, and butler; both which offices
appear to unite in this servant, who, in his
dress, generally imitates the <em>jemmadar</em>, or the
<em>chobe-dar</em>. Those who have but rarely seen a
table laid out in India, must wonder at the elegance,
and perfection, which may there often
be found: this must appear still more surprizing,
when it is considered, that none of those
concerned in the preparation of the viands,
would, on any account, taste of them during the
course of preparation, any more than when returned
from the table. It must not be supposed,
that every servant bearing this description is
equally acquainted with the several minutiæ the
character ought to include: in fact, but very few
of them possess such qualifications as should
entitle to pre-eminence: generally, some of the
more observant, or intelligent, of table-attendants
of the lower order, contrive by application,
and even by paying those <em>kansamahs</em> who are
considered clever in their business, to climb up
the ladder of menial rank, and ultimately to reach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>this station; which is the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ne plus ultra</em></span> in its
branch of servitude. The wages are supposed
to correspond with the talents; but, there being
no scale whereby to regulate estimation, we
may be better guided, in this particular, by the
rank of the employer; though a few instances
may be adduced wherein epicures, of very
moderate income, have retained <em>kansamahs</em> at
very exorbitant rates. Perhaps I may be right
in taking from twelve to fifteen rupees for a common
standard; from fifteen to twenty in families
of rank, or opulence; and from twenty to forty
among the first circle. I have known instances
far beyond even that monthly stipend: a few
cases might be adduced where not less than <em>a
hundred rupees</em> have been given! As that corresponds
with £l50. per annum of British currency,
a sum which all below princely magnificence
could but indifferently afford, it may
be concluded, that, in the East, as well as in
the West, there are to be found individuals who
think no expence too great, when their appetite
and taste are to be indulged.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Sircar</em> is a genius whose whole study is
to handle money, whether receivable or payable;
and who contrives either to confuse accounts,
when they are adverse to his view; or to render
them most expressively intelligible, when such
would suit his purpose. These rogues are
pretty nearly the same as the Madras <em>debashes</em>:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>I believe all, who have experienced the kind
offices of either, will readily confess that no
compleater knaves are to be found in any part of
the world. And this under the most sedulous
appearance both to please, and to serve, those
whom they are about to plunder. As <em>peons</em> and
<em>hirkarahs</em> rise to be <em>chobe-dars</em>, and <em>jemmadars</em>;
and as <em>khedmutgars</em> succeed to the appointment
of <em>kansamahs</em>; so may <em>sircars</em> in time become
<em>banians</em>, <em>dewans</em>, <em>darogahs</em>, <em>gomastahs</em>, &amp;c.
Many of them even set up as <em>shroffs</em>, or bankers,
and establish such an extent of credit as would
astonish the inhabitants of Lombard Street.
There are <em>sircars</em> of all ages, and of all degrees;
from the shrewd lad of twelve, to the superannuated
monster, whose sixty, or seventy, years of
worldly intercourse, may be considered a record
of fraud and extortion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing can perhaps be more forcible in exposing
the characteristic traits of <em>sircars</em>, than
the fact of their ordinarily tendering their services
to young men, under the declaration that <em>they
seek for no pay</em>; nor for remuneration in any form,
beyond the <em>pleasure</em> of laying out master’s
money to the best advantage. I should premise,
that, on account of the immense variety of coins
current in India, it is customary, whenever any
large sum is to be received, to employ an examiner,
called a <em>podar</em>; who, having confined
his pursuits to the acquirement of a most accurate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>knowledge of their several values, at once
decides upon the correctness of a payment.
The precision, quickness, and touch, of these
persons, are beyond description. I have been
assured that many of them can, even in the
dark, distinguish between several kinds of
money, whose size and weight bear no great
dissimilarity: besides, even those coins that
bear the same value, and come from the same
mint, differ greatly in both those particulars;
some being broad and flat, like a shilling, though
not defaced; while others are more dumpy,
and, though of purer metal, not so ponderous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the <em>sircars</em>, especially of late years,
unite the office of <em>podar</em> with their own business.
This, it will be supposed, should enable them to
secure their employer from loss, but is, on all
occasions, made the means of injuring both his
pocket and his credit, by passing inferior money
at an unjust value into his chest, and issuing
it at a <em>less</em> rate, if to a native colleague; but, if
to an European, then at a <em>higher</em> value; the
<em>sircars</em> of each joining in the device: when circumstances
fit, this operation is reversed. I am
prepared for the following obvious question;
viz. ‘If the master knew the rate at which the
money was paid to him, how happens it, that,
after entering it in his books, he allows it to be
paid away at a different, or, at least, at a lower,
rate, than that at which it was received?’</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>This query should appear sufficient to stagger
any person to whom it might be put; but to a
<em>sircar</em> would not prove in the smallest degree
difficult of solution. He immediately tells
master, that the <em>batta</em>, <i>i.e.</i> the exchange, is
altered, and, in saying that much, he may have
the truth on his side. I have already hinted at
the fluctuations that take place in all coins,
whether gold, silver, or copper. This up and
down price of money, if I may use the expression,
is managed by the <em>shroffs</em>, or native bankers;
who invariably, except on particular holidays,
meet towards midnight, compare accounts, and
settle the value of money for the succeeding
day. Notice is accordingly circulated in an underhand
manner; and, throughout the great
town of Calcutta, covering perhaps three thousand
acres, and well peopled, the whole of the
parties concerned, nay, even the ordinary retail
shop-keepers, are apprized of the alteration.
Sometimes the exchange is allowed to remain at
the same rate for a few days in succession: this
rarely takes place except when a particular currency,
say silver, is to be bought up at a low
rate, such as 58 or 60 <em>pice</em> to a <em>rupee</em>, to be sold
again when the rate has been, for that purpose,
raised to 64, or 65. So soon as either purpose
is accomplished, the exchange alters by the
same invisible means.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of <em>pice</em> in a <em>rupee</em> constitutes its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>value; as the number of rupees and <em>annas</em> do
that of a <em>gold mohur</em>; which, if <em>sicca</em>, from the
Calcutta mint, ought invariably to pass at sixteen
rupees. But the regulations of government
have too often been openly trespassed, in the
most daring manner. This was carried to such
a pitch, that the whole of the silver currency at
one time disappeared; the <em>shroffs</em> and <em>sircars</em> had
bought it all up; so that persons in business
were induced to offer premiums for silver;
without which mercantile concerns could not
proceed. It is a well known fact, that, for some
months, the troops at the presidency were paid
in gold, issued to them at par; but which,
owing to the infamous combinations above described,
would not pass in any part of the market,
unless a deduction of one-eighth was
allowed! <em>Sircars</em> contrive to defraud all parties
with whom their masters may have concerns;
thereby disgracing them on many occasions,
especially in payment of card-debts; which are
soon distinguished by this <em>Argus</em> race.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the advantages thus made, the <em>sircars</em>
derive a very considerable emolument from all
purchases made in the markets, of whatever description.
Whenever an European, even in person,
buys goods of a native, his servants have,
from time immemorial, a claim on the vendor of
half an anna in every rupee the latter receives.
This, which is called <em>dustooree</em>, or customary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>gift, being a thirty-second of the disbursement,
amounts to no less than 3⅛ per cent.: it may
therefore be imagined what immense sums these
gentry must pocket, when serving gentlemen
who have large establishments to support, and
whose servants are numerous: for even from the
very domestics does the <em>sircar</em> claim the above
gratuity, when paying their wages!</p>

<p class='c008'>Military persons have little occasion for such
servants; therefore, unless in eligible circumstances,
and of a very liberal disposition, a <em>sircar</em>
will not think it worth his while to serve an
officer on a small salary. But it is quite different
where a young civilian is in question; to
him the rogue’s purse is instantly opened; not
only with a view to make him, like the steward
in Gil Blas, pay interest for his own money,
but under the hope of attaching firmly to the
rising sun, and ultimately of being <em>banian</em>, <em>naib</em>,
<em>dewan</em>; of course, ascending to the very acmé
of prosperity. Those <em>sircars</em> who are employed
by mercantile, or manufacturing persons, derive
the advantages attendant on the foregoing transactions
in a less degree than when serving an
individual divested of such concerns; but they
gradually acquire large property, and are often
placed in situations of great trust; such as <em>darogahs</em>
and <em>gomastahs</em>. In such establishments
they are, for the major part, relatives to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span><em>banian</em>, who assists with his purse on emergency;
therefore, though they may feel the necessity
of paying attention to their ostensible
employer, they pay their court, under the rose,
chiefly to the former. The rates of wages are,
in this branch, progressive; some receiving a
bare livelihood, such as from five to eight rupees
monthly; while those of longer standing, or
who are more in favor with the <em>banian</em>, sometimes
receive from fifteen to thirty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of <em>sircars</em> is extremely simple: their
heads are shaved, with the exception of one
lock, about two inches in diameter at the base,
which is held sacred, and is tied in a kind of
loose bow-knot. The turban is white, of fine
muslin, wrapped perhaps fifteen or twenty times
round the head, leaving the crown nearly bare,
and the lock of hair protruding. Round the
waist a piece of cloth is passed, so as to allow
freedom of motion; then tucked in, in a peculiar
manner, and one skirt, passing between
the thighs, is, in like manner, secured behind.
Unless in cold weather, the body and arms are
left entirely bare; in moderate seasons, they are
covered by means of a cloth sewed into two
breadths, thrown over the shoulders: a chintz
quilt is likewise worn at times.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the convenience of keeping accounts, and
of making payments, one <em>sircar</em> is allowed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Company to each battalion of sepoys. It is surprizing
to see how these men, whose utmost
legal receipts can amount to only twenty rupees
monthly, get forward, and become possessed of
property. Much money goes through their
hands, and, as before observed, every finger is a
file which takes off a trifle <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en passant</em></span>. This
class of servants rarely associate, in any degree,
with the others; they form, in fact, a separate
tribe of Hindus, and devote their time to one
object, viz. making money. They generally read
English well enough to know the contents of a
bill; but, in giving receipts, usually sign their
names in the Bengallee character: few of them
undertake to write English accounts; but, in
their own way, which appears to us prolix, they
are extremely regular. The superiors seldom
touch a pen, leaving that office to those servants
who are entitled to confidence, and causing the
less expert to act as collecting clerks; an employ
in which they are eminently punctual, as most
young debtors throughout the East must acknowledge.
It is a peculiar circumstance, that scarcely
an instance has been known of a <em>sircar</em> absconding
with the money entrusted to him: from this,
however, I exempt the vile crew of tide waiters,
who are by no means scrupulous; though, for
the sake of perpetuating their game, which
any open act of felony might break up, they
prefer extracting the money from the novice’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>pocket, by means of extortion and fraudulent
accounts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Considering him as being at least attached to,
if not of the very same species, as the knave
just described, I shall give a short description of
the <em>Podar</em>; of whom mention has already been
made. He is not always an attendant at an
office, though, in great concerns, his presence
is indispensable. He either receives from four
to ten rupees per month, or is paid, by a very
small centage, for whatever money he examines.
We often admire the dexterity of our money-tellers;
but the <em>podar</em>, who counts by fours,
(<i>i.e.</i> <em>gundahs</em>,) finishes the detail of a thousand
in so short a time, as would cause even our most
expert money-tellers to stare with astonishment!
It is only mixed money that is counted, when
large sums are passing; most payments are first
sorted, when, the several kinds of rupees being
made into parcels, are weighed, fifty at a time: in
this manner, a lac (<i>i.e.</i> a 100,000) may be speedily
ascertained; each parcel of fifty being kept
separate, until a certain number is completed:
when the whole are accounted, and removed into
bags, to make way for further operations. Here
it may be proper to remark, that no <em>sircar</em> will
take charge of money when his employer keeps
the key: nor is it, on the other hand, customary
for the <em>sircar</em> to have the entire charge. So
many tricks have been played by changing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>coin, that it is now a general rule for every
treasure-chest to have two large padlocks, of
different construction; the <em>sircar</em>, or <em>tusseel-dar</em>
(<em>cash keeper</em>,) receiving one key, and the master
retaining the other. This prevents aggression
on either part, but is by no means pleasing to
the <em>banians</em>, though they affect to be highly
satisfied, because a command of specie will often
enable them to make very advantageous purchases
in Company’s paper; but such a precaution
inevitably debars their access to master’s
cash.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Cranny</em>, or clerk, may be either a native
Armenian, a native Portugueze, or a Bengallee:
the former are not very common; the second
are more numerous; but the third are every
where to be seen. It really is wonderful how
well many of the latter can write, without understanding
a word of what is written. They
have a steady hand, a keen eye, and an admirable
readiness in casting up accounts. Those
who are habituated to our mode of book keeping,
profess to consider it greatly superior to their
own, but it is not a very easy matter to get
them into it. That multiplicity of fractions which
prevails, in consequence of the perpetual fluctuation
in their currency, causes them to be very
well versed in that branch of arithmetic, and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>produce the most correct calculations. The
rates of wages are different according to the
abilities of individuals; thus, a clever <em>cranny</em> in
a public office, such as the auditor general’s, or
the pay-master general’s, or the assay and mint,
may receive from forty to a hundred rupees
monthly, while, in mercantile houses, they rarely
receive more than thirty, generally, indeed, from
ten to twenty; while many are glad to serve
gratis, merely for the purpose of an introduction
to that line of employment; as well as to perfect
themselves in book keeping, and in a proper
style of correspondence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The use these gentry make of English words,
is often highly diverting: they study synonymes
very industriously; poring over Johnson’s dictionary,
and carefully selecting such terms, as
appear to them least in use; thinking that such
must, of course, make finer language. The following
may serve as a specimen: it was written
by a <em>cranny</em> to his master, in consequence of an
exterior window shutter having been blown
down by a severe north-wester.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Honorable Sir,</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Yesterday vesper arrive great hurricane;
valve of little aperture not fasten; first
make great trepidation and palpitation, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>precipitate into precinct. God grant master
more long life, and more great post.</p>

<div class='c010'>I remain,</div>
<div class='c026'>Honorable Sir,</div>
<div class='c012'>in all token of respect,</div>
<div class='c027'>Master’s writer,</div>
<div class='c028'><span class='fss'>BISSONAUT METRE</span>.’</div>

<p class='c008'>‘P.S. No tranquillity in house since valve adjourn.—I
send for carpenter to make re-unite.’</p>

<p class='c029'>Those unacquainted with the pedantry of Bengallee
writers, may suspect me of coining for the
occasion; placing the above on a footing with
Smollet’s ‘Horse-spittle of anvil-heads,’ &amp;c.;
but I assure my readers, that it is a literal transcript
from a note of which the original was in
my father’s possession for many years; it is by
no means so preposterous as many that have,
on account of their ridiculous diction, been
published in the Calcutta papers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of a Bengallee <em>cranny</em> is exactly the
same as that of the <em>sircar</em>, of which tribe he
may be considered a relative. The Portugueze
<em>cranny</em>, assumes the British dress; but the
Armenian invariably retains that of his own
country, which is truly becoming. They shave
their heads, and wear black velvet bonnets, not
unlike a mitre in form. Their vests are of white
linen, and reach down to their knees, so as not
to conceal the knee-bands of their small-cloaths.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>Their coats, or tunics, are usually made of colored
silk, for the most part purple, lilac, crimson,
or brown, and flow loosely rather below
their vests; the sleeves are loose, and there is
no collar. They use also stockings and shoes;
and, when within doors, lay aside their black
bonnets, wearing in their stead white skull-caps,
round like a small bowl, and often neatly
tamboured with colored silks. They have
pockets both in their vests, and in their small-cloaths:
some wear girdles, under their tunics;
and some wear silken sashes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having disposed of those who pride themselves
as appertaining to the <em>nokeron</em>, it remains
to detail the services, &amp;c. of such as come
under the general designation of <em>chaukeron</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Khedmutgar</em>, or, as he is often termed, the
<em>kismutgar</em>, is, with very few exceptions, a Mussulman:
his business is to prepare all the apparatus,
and to wait at table. For this purpose,
he repairs to the house of his employer shortly
after day-break; when, after seeing that the
breakfast apartment has been swept, and taking
care that the bearers have put on a kettle, he
lays the cloth, with small plates, knives, forks,
spoons, &amp;c. together with bread, butter, sweetmeats,
&amp;c. but reserving all the tea-things for
a side-table; at which, if there be no <em>kansamah</em>,
he officiates, making the tea, coffee, chocolate,
cocoa, or whatever is ordered. Where there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>an European lady in the family, she may, perhaps,
have the cups, &amp;c. set upon the breakfast
table; but, on account of the steam arising from
the various preparations, this custom is by no
means general; and often, after being persevered
in for a while, is relinquished in favor of the
bachelor’s mode; which is in every respect, the
most comfortable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every gentleman must have one <em>khedmutgar</em>;
but the majority keep two, or even more; not
only adding thereby to their own expence, but
considerably incommoding every party in which
they may dine. As every gentleman, when at
table, is attended by his own servants, it may
easily be conceived, that where two or more are
posted behind each guest, a living enclosure is
formed, tending by its own exhalations, added
to those from their masters, and from the viands,
to banish comfort, and to render all artificial
means of cooling the apartment perfectly abortive.
Hence it is usual, at all public entertainments,
to admit but one servant for each person
invited: on some occasions a better plan is
adopted, namely, that of employing only as
many servants as may be deemed absolutely necessary:
but this, though obviously judicious,
rarely gives satisfaction; habit having so strongly
confirmed, what luxury so very insagaciously
invented. Gentlemen fixed at Calcutta, or at
any place, as residents, cause plates, knives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>forks, spoons, napkins, and glasses, to be laid
for the whole company; but at all military stations,
each guest sends his servant with two
plates, a soup plate, a small plate for bones,
&amp;c. a tumbler, a long glass for claret, and a
smaller for Madeira, a table spoon, a dessert
spoon, perhaps also a marrow spoon, two or
three knives and forks, and a napkin: these are
usually taken to the rendezvous by one of his
<em>khedmutgars</em>, who accompanies the <em>aub-dar</em>; the
latter causing a bearer with a <em>bangy</em>, or sling, to
carry the apparatus for cooling water.</p>

<p class='c008'>However luxurious the latter custom may
seem, yet I do not know any more gratifying,
or more conducive to health. A glass of cold
water is at times invaluable!</p>

<p class='c008'>When seated at table, the <em>khedmutgar</em> stands
behind his master, changing his plates, &amp;c.
which are cleaned by servants without; and,
either keeping him cool by means of a small
hand-fan, made of palm-tree; or driving away
the flies with a whisk, called a <em>chowry</em>, made of
the hair from a wild ox’s tail, or of a peacocks’
feathers, or of the roots of grass, called <em>cuss-cuss</em>,
&amp;c. often, however, these offices are left
to a bearer, who likewise stands, behind his
master’s chair, for that purpose. After dinner
the <em>khedmutgars</em> retire to their own homes,
and, about sun-set, attend their respective masters,
if they have remained; but should they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>sup where they dined, as is customary where
suppers are laid, the attendance is repeated, the
same as at dinner time; after which the <em>khedmutgars</em>
go to their respective houses, without
ceremony. The pay of this menial varies from
five, to perhaps ten, rupees monthly; but the
generality receive from six to eight. Much depends
on the rank of the employer, and whether
the <em>khedmutgar</em> is ever expected to officiate as
<em>kansamah</em>: such is, indeed, the case with the
families of single gentlemen, not in possession
of large receipts; but the officiating <em>khedmutgar</em>
is honored, almost invariably, by all the other
servants, with the title of <em>khansamah</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is such distinction always ill-bestowed;
many of those who serve under gentlemen of a
liberal disposition, and who take pleasure in
keeping a good table, may fairly competite with,
at least, half the servants actually entitled to
that designation, in all the knowledge requisite
to support its character. Few, however, of
those who become thus capable of managing all
that appertains to domestic economy, refrain
from making attempts to enter the superior
circle. Nor are there wanting persons ready to
seduce such good servants from the employ of
their acquaintances. About eight and twenty
years ago, when it was the fashion to wear the
hair, both of ladies and of gentlemen, full
dressed, a good peruquier was an indispensable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>part of the establishment: the great difficulty
of procuring persons properly qualified, induced
several gentlemen to have lads instructed under
those who were known to be expert; this often
cost from eighty to a hundred rupees (ten or
twelve guineas); but, in many instances, so
soon as the pupils had learned the business, offers
were made clandestinely from other quarters,
sometimes by intimate friends of their masters;
when some little disagreement was started so as
to give pretext for quitting. I must remark, at
the same time, that I believe the gentlemen of
India are more scrupulous, and more delicate,
in matters of this nature, than those in any
other quarter: but we must not expect all to be
perfect; still less to be disinterested!</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Khedmutgars</em> are, with few exceptions, the
sons of <em>ayahs</em>, <em>dhyes</em>, &amp;c. in the service of European,
or native, ladies: their first introduction
to the table commonly takes place when about
eight, or nine, years of age; at which period
children in that quarter are usually smart, intelligent,
and well-featured. At first they attend
only at home; not receiving any wages, or so
little as barely to suffice for clothing: by degrees
they become useful, and are allowed to attend
abroad. From this it may be concluded, that,
too often, a kind of compact, or coalition, takes
place behind the curtain, not very favorable to
either the pocket, or the brows, of the employer.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>When we consider the various opportunities
both for peculation, and for intrigue,
possessed by <em>khedmutgars</em> so initiated, we cannot
refrain from condemning that practice, which is
too generally prevalent; and which we should
suppose could not fail to produce some inquietude:
such, however, is rarely the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dresses of <em>khedmutgars</em> are generally of the
same form; but the quality of the cloth, the length
of the skirts, and sleeves, and the trimmings, are
matters of great consequence in the eyes of this
vain tribe. All endeavor to obtain <em>turbans</em> and
<em>cummer-bunds</em> (<i>i.e.</i> waist-cloths) of the same
color, and are not the less pleased if a tassel of
silver fringe be added to the outer end of the
former. During the hot season, a <em>coortah</em>, or
vest, reaching at least to the knees, of white
calico, or of chintz, is worn; but, during the
winter, one of perpet, or other woollen of European
manufacture, is held to be more respectable.
The long-drawers are ordinarily white,
or of striped gingham; though some great favorites,
and debauchees, who pride themselves
on being favorites among the ladies, often wear
a kind of silk stuff, called <em>gool-budden</em>, such as
is used by women above the middle class, and
denotes effeminacy, or a disposition to intrigue.
The origin of such a type of libertinism may
commonly be traced to the <em>haram</em>; probably to
that of the fop’s own master.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>The office of <em>Mosaulchy</em>, or flambeau-bearer,
may be considered another introduction, or
rather an apprenticeship, to the foregoing. A
lad serving in this capacity should be agile,
smart, and careful; having to run for miles as
fast as the ordinary rate of a carriage; he
will find abundance of work in cleaning boots,
shoes, knives, dishes, &amp;c. together with a million
of et ceteras, which fit him for the title
of ‘Jack of all trades.’ Many valuable articles
in glass-ware and crockery, being given to
his charge, for the purpose of being washed, it
is indispensably necessary that his whole attention
be devoted thereto. During the time a lad
remains as a <em>mosaulchy</em>, he may acquire much
experience relating to the duties of a <em>khedmutgar</em>:
some are to be seen, in the service of persons
in rather low circumstances, acting in both
capacities, and carrying the umbrella; which is
properly the duty of a bearer: but, where the
<em>mosaulchy</em> performs the <em>khedmutgar’s</em> duties,
bearers are rarely kept. Few <em>mosaulchies</em> are
allowed more than five rupees monthly, and then
on the proviso of supplying the flambeaux and
the oil, where such are used. The general pay
is about four rupees; the master, as is now
almost every where prevalent, using a lantern instead
of a <em>mosaul</em>, (or flambeau,) and supplying
ends of wax candles, or whole ones of tallow,
for that purpose. Many of this description of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>servants begin as <em>coolies</em>, or laborers, and gradually
acquire sufficient insight to be admitted
into the services of non-commissioned officers,
&amp;c.; whence they take the opportunity of removing
into the employ of gentlemen. Others
start from the sepoy regiments, in which they
have served as <em>goorgahs</em>, or fags, to some native
officer, &amp;c.; but these are more rare; the generality
of our sepoys being Hindus, to whom
various domestic operations occurring in the
families of Europeans are obnoxious, on account
of the nature of many aliments in use among us.
The <em>mosaul</em>, or flambeau, consists of old rags,
wrapped very closely around a small stick; it is
generally about two feet in length, and may be
two inches and a half in diameter; an iron ring
fits on, so as to confine the fire within about an
inch at the tip: being refreshed, from time to
time, with oil extracted from the sesamum, it
burns with great fierceness; as the cloth consumes,
the ring is brought back, by means of an
old fork, thereby renovating the flame. The
oil is either carried in a glass bottle, to the embouchure
of which a reed is fitted, to prevent
spilling; or it is contained in a brass vessel,
made expressly for the purpose, and thence
called a <em>tale daunny</em> (<i>i.e.</i> oil-pot,) which may
hold nearly a quart.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of a <em>mosaulchy</em> consists of a turban,
generally colored; a short pair of drawers, reaching
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>half way down the thigh, nearly the same as
the <em>jangheeahs</em> of the native soldiery; and a
cloth, wrapped round the waist. But where this
servant is at any time employed to wait at table,
he imitates the dress of the <em>khedmutgar</em>, so far as
his pocket may allow. Persons of distinction,
among both Europeans and natives, cause their
<em>mosaulchies</em> to carry what are called branch-lights.
These consist of a semi-circular frame
of iron, supported on a centre stem, to which
the side ribs join; upon the circumference are
five or seven spikes, on each of which a small
<em>mosaul</em> is stuck. When they are all lighted, and
raised above the head, by means of the stem,
they make a great show. Commonly two, or,
eventually, three branch-lights, may be seen preceding
a great personage, intermixed with his
retinue: two or more ordinary <em>mosauls</em>, or lanterns,
are also carried near the palanquin, to
prevent the bearers from stumbling.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next upon our list is the <em>Hookah-burdar</em>,
or preparer of the pipe; a domestic of wondrous
consequence with many gentlemen, who give
themselves up, almost wholly, to the enjoyment
of smoking. Some begin before they have half
breakfasted; whiffing away, with little intermission,
till they retire to rest: I know not of
any custom which becomes so habitual! It is
inconceivable how distressed some are, in consequence
of their <em>hookahs</em> not arriving in time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>particularly when on a march: at such moments,
nothing goes right: <em>hookah! hookah! hookah!</em>
seem to be the three indispensables towards
happiness. Some few may plead in apology,
that, without its aid, they would be subject to
an irregularity, such as rarely fails to induce severe
illness: when this is the case, we cannot
censure the practice, provided it be confined to
that duration which may produce the salutary
stimulus; and which, it is obvious, must be rather
weakened, than aided, by the subsequent use of
smoke during the rest of the day. To so great
an extreme is this carried, that I have known
more than one instance of two <em>hookah-burdars</em>
being retained; one for the day, the other for
the night. Where such prevails, it may be
rationally concluded the wages are in proportion:
in most services, these may be from ten, to fifteen,
rupees per month; occasionally somewhat
less, but rarely exceeding; except where excessive
partiality for his pipe induces a gentleman
to give more, under the common error of expecting
satisfaction in proportion to the disbursement.
To such an egregious excess has this
opinion led some persons, that I have heard of no
less than one hundred rupees per month having
been given to a <em>hookah-burdar</em>. Yet, many gentlemen,
supposed to be judges, were unanimous
in declaring, that such high-priced preparations
were very inferior to the generality of those obtained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>at that moderate expence usually incurred
by persons contenting themselves with mediocrity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some instances, the whole expence lies
with the <em>hookah-burdar</em>, who receives such a
sum as may, besides his wages, include tobacco,
<em>gools</em>, (or fire-balls,) and <em>chillums</em>, (or sockets for
receiving the <em>towah</em>, or tile,) on which the prepared
tobacco is applied. Some even provide
the <em>snakes</em>, or pliable conductors.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to the tobacco used for smoking,
‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tot homines, tot sententiæ</em></span>;’ in that particular
few are to be found of the same opinion: and
among those that are, probably more than half
are under the grossest deception. The little
village of Bilsah, in the Maharrattah country,
has been long celebrated, and it should seem
not without reason, for the fragrance of the
tobacco raised around it. But the quantity of
tobacco sold annually throughout Bengal, where
it produces from thirty to sixty, and even eighty
rupees per maund, (if ascertained to be genuine,)
is known to exceed, full an hundred fold, the
amount of any crop ever raised at Bilsah. The
substitutes are various, but one kind, raised in
the <em>Bundelcund</em> district, supplies the greater
portion; many, indeed, are of opinion that it is
not inferior. May not its excellence be owing
to the practice, common in that quarter, of
sprinkling the plants at harvest time with a solution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of molasses? We know that many fruits
yield but little of their flavor, until excited by
the saccharine acid: the raspberry may serve to
coroborate my position. I have known that
very cheap kind of tobacco, the <em>Cuggareah</em>,
which ordinarily sells for about four rupees per
maund, (of 82 lb.) rendered so mellow, and so
fragrant, by being worked up with molasses,
and kept in close vessels for some months, as
absolutely to be admired even by persons who
prided themselves on never smoking any but the
true Bilsah!</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual mode of preparing tobacco for the
<em>hookah</em>, is by first chopping it very small; then,
adding ripe plantains, molasses, or raw sugar,
together with some cinnamon, and other aromatics;
keeping the mass, which resembles an
electuary, in close vessels. When about to be
used, it is again worked up well; some, at that
time, add a little tincture of musk, or a few
grains of that perfume, others prefer pouring a
solution of it, or a little rose water, down the
<em>snake</em>, at the moment the <em>hookah</em> is introduced:
in either case, the fragrance of the tobacco is
effectually superceded; giving ample scope for
the <em>hookah-burdar</em> to serve up rank <em>mundungus</em>,
(as bad tobacco is termed,) in lieu of the supposed,
or perhaps the real, <em>Bilsah</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>hookah-burdar</em> rarely fails to smoke of
the best his master may at any time possess;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>which, however highly perfumed, will rarely be
strong enough for his gratification: the deficiency
is supplied by the admixture of <em>bang</em>; a
preparation from the leaves of the <em>ganjah</em>, or
hemp, (the <em>cannabis sativus</em>,) and is extremely
intoxicating. The leaves of that plant, when
triturated with water, compose a drink of the
same tendency, known by the name of <em>subzy</em>,
(<i>i.e.</i> green,) which is a constant beverage among
the more established sinners, who rarely fail,
towards nightfall, to take an ample dose, of
either <em>bang</em>, <em>subzy</em>, or <em>majoom</em>: the latter being
sweetmeats impregnated with a decoction of the
<em>ganjah</em>, or hemp plant, much used by all debauchees,
and too often admitted within the
sacred area of the <em>zenanah</em>, (or haram). The use
of any preparation of the <em>ganjah</em>, or hemp plant,
is attended with much opprobrium: like most
intoxicating drugs and spirits, they, in the first
instance, excite to gaiety, but ultimately leave
their victim in the most deplorable state of stupefaction;
the recovery from which is attended
with dreadful headache, ill temper, and hypochondria.
Some <em>hookah-burdars</em> indulge freely
in the use of musk, which never fails, after a
while, to produce considerable derangement of
the nerves; and, not unfrequently, that complete
debility which is ever attended with the
greatest depressure of spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very common species of debauchery, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>which I have known only one or two gentlemen
to indulge, is the incorporation of opium with
the prepared tobacco, previous to its being spread
upon the <em>towah</em>; a custom so repugnant to discretion,
as to leave little room for animadversion,
the folly being usually of very short duration,
and, intermediately, attended with the
most abject degradation. Many native princes,
and others, who have been hurled from their
thrones, or from offices of trust, are said to have
been treacherously overcome by means of opium
thus administered: it appears to me very practicable,
by such a device, to lull a whole guard
to sleep; for few can resist the offer of a whiff
when the <em>goorgoory</em> (a small kind of <em>hookah</em> used
by the lower classes) is passing round. Among
such trash as is generally sold to the poor, who
care not much about the flavor, so long as they
can draw abundance of smoke, the opium would
probably, if at all tasted, rather give a zest, than
prove an objection, to the indulgence. It is
asserted, that if a capsicum be put among the
<em>gools</em>, or be mixed with the tobacco, fatal consequences
will ensue; an instant attack of apoplexy
taking place. This I have never known
to be done; therefore am incapable of producing
any testimony, one way or the other: but it
appears rather doubtful whether any reasoning,
or analogy, could be adduced in support of
the assertion; the acrid stimulus would, in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>probability, be dissipated, rendering the residue
as inert as any other raw culinary vegetable.
Admitting it to be true, that a capsicum can
produce such an effect, a very strong argument
against smoking may be adduced: no man would,
altogether, relish the idea of being so perpetually
in the power of a debauchee, who might,
either through resentment, or by a small bribe,
be induced to bestow a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>quietus</em></span>, without the possibility
of a discovery. In such case, the <em>hookah-burdar</em>
would have all the advantages of an
inimical cook, without the danger of his narcotic
being detected.</p>

<p class='c008'>However complicated the <em>hookah</em> may appear,
it is, nevertheless, extremely easy of construction.
I have been told, that one has been made
in England; and I have seen a few in use, that
were brought from Bengal. The preparation of
the tobacco with apples, in lieu of plantains, is
equally simple and approved. The <em>kaleaun</em>, or
small kind of <em>hookah</em>, used on the west coast of
India, is certainly commodious: it has a larger
bottom, in general, than the Bengal <em>hookah</em>;
though I have seen some very small, with beautiful
imitations of flowers, and of coral, shells,
&amp;c. within them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the real Persian <em>kaleauns</em> exhibit considerable
ingenuity, and taste, on the part of
their manufacturers. In the centre of the interior,
bunches of flowers, beautifully colored, far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>too large, and too delicate, to have been introduced
at the embouchures of the vessels, may
be seen. Over these, the glass, which is rarely
of the best quality, though far superior to any I
have seen of Hindostanee formation, has evidently
been cast, or blown. Many of these
artificial bouquets are, however, made piece-meal,
as I discovered by examining their construction,
after their exterior cases had been
accidentally broken: such were found to consist
of a cone of rosin firmly cemented to the bottom
of the <em>kaleaun</em>, by heat; it appeared that the
several leaves, branches, flowers, birds, &amp;c.
were introduced one after the other, in a heated
state, and applied to the rosin, in which they
buried themselves sufficiently to retain a firm
hold. I likewise ascertained that some models
of Persian architecture were combined in the same
manner; while, on the other hand, others,
especially small figures of great personages,
seated on thrones, elephants, &amp;c. were never
subjected to that device: in the latter instance,
some grapes were, however, joined in the manner
above described.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>goorgoory</em> is a very small kind of <em>hookah</em>,
intended to be conveyed in a palanquin, or to be
carried about a house; the person who smokes
holding a vase-shaped bottom by its neck, and
drawing through a stiff, instead of a pliant, pipe,
formed of a reed, arched into such a shape as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>should conduct its end conveniently to the
mouth. In this, the pipe is rarely more than a
yard in length: it is an implement very generally
used by the middling classes of natives; and
especially among the women in <em>harams</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>neriaul</em> is nothing more than a cocoa-nut,
with the pipe-stem thrust through a hole at its
top, and a piece of reed, about a cubit long,
applied to another hole rather lower down. The
nut-shell, being half filled with water, the air,
or rather the smoke, we might suppose would
be cooled; but, from observation, I much doubt
whether any change takes place in the temperament
of either. These little <em>hookahs</em>, (for, however
paltry, their owners do not omit to give
them that designation,) are often used without
any reed to conduct the smoke; the lips being,
in that case, applied to the small lateral aperture
into which the reed should be fitted. One of
these usually serves half a dozen men, who pass
it round with great glee: it often forms an appendage
about the feet of a palanquin, if the
opportunity offers for securing it there, without
master’s knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of a <em>hookah-burdar</em>, in the service
of a gentleman of rank, approaches nearly to
that of a <em>chobe-dar</em>; a <em>jamma</em> being generally
worn by such, but, in more humble situations,
the <em>courtah</em> of a <em>khedmutgar</em> is common. In the
former situation, his office is confined entirely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>to the <em>hookah</em>; while, in the latter, he is generally
expected to wait at table, at least, on occasion;
but wherever the master, of whatever
rank, may go, thither the <em>hookah-burdar</em> is expected
to proceed, so as to furnish the pipe in
due season after dinner, or at any other time it
may be required. The ordinary periods for
smoking, are, after breakfast, after dinner, after
tea, and after supper: such may be deemed
regular; and, if no more than two or three
charges are used, at each time, are by no means
considered extraordinary. I have already stated,
that some gentlemen smoke day and night.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such a climate, water is, during four
months, at least, the main spring of existence,
both in the animal, and the vegetable, kingdom;
consequently, its supply becomes a profession,
giving bread to thousands. The person officiating
in this capacity, if provided with a bullock
for the purpose of conveying two large leather
bags, each containing about twenty gallons, is
called a <em>Puckaully</em>; but if he carries the water
himself, in the skin of a goat, prepared for that
purpose, he then receives the designation of
<em>Bheesty</em>. The bags for a <em>puckaully</em> are made of
strong hide, sewed very firmly at the front,
which is at right angles with the bottom, where
the leather doubles, and, consequently, has no
seam; the back part, is diagonal, forming a kind
of spout behind, opposite the bullock’s knee;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>while the top is left open, rather in a funnel
form, for about a foot that the water may be
poured in: the spout is first rolled up, and then
tied with a strong strip of leather.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every <em>puckaully</em> carries also a small bag, that
he may serve as an ordinary ‘<em>hand-bheesty</em>’,
when required. This is made of the skin of a
goat, taken off in a particular manner. Being
put into a solution of lime, the hair soon quits;
when the inside fleshings are carefully scraped
off. A tan is then made of the bark of <em>baubool</em>,
(mimosa), <em>khut</em>, (catechu,) and alum.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Bheesties</em> are, with few exceptions, Mussulmans;
it being contrary to the Hindu code to
touch either the carcases, or the skins, of animals
killed in any way. Hence, a Hindu of
this profession is extremely rare, and will seldom
be discovered; owing to the necessity for
change of name, so as to pass for a Mussulman.
Hindus will, nevertheless, drink of the water
supplied from the <em>mussock</em>, (or <em>bheesty-bag</em>);
though they are extremely partial to such as
they can draw themselves, by means of a line
and metal pot, with which most travellers are
provided. Some few are, to be sure, extravagantly
scrupulous, and will undergo excessive
thirst, rather than partake of the <em>bheesty’s</em> supply.
Dust, heat, and fatigue, however, rarely
fail, after a while, to overcome such ill-timed
fastidiousness. The <em>puckaullies</em>, or, as they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>usually called, the <em>bullock-bheesties</em>, replenish
their bags by driving their cattle into some <em>tank</em>,
or pond, up to their knees, or even deeper, then
baling in the water, by means of a small leather
bucket, holding about two quarts, or more.
The <em>hand-bheesty</em> usually sinks his bag under
water, when it soon fills. When drawing water
from the wells, the leather bucket, called a <em>dole</em>,
is used by both the <em>puckaully</em> and the <em>hand-bheesty</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The constant application of a wet skin to the
cloaths on the hip, necessarily disposes them to
rot: on this account, most <em>bheesties</em> provide
themselves with a piece of cloth, called <em>karwah</em>,
which, being dyed in grain with a composition,
whereof the solution of shell-lac forms a large
portion, resists the effects of the moisture, better
than any other substance in use for apparel.
The wages of a <em>hand-bheesty</em>, may be from four
to five rupees, according to the agreement,
whether he is to furnish his own <em>mussock</em>, &amp;c.
which is the general mode. His duty, during
the cold season, and in the rains, is mere pastime;
he has then but little to do beyond the
supply of water to horses, and filling a few
pots for culinary purposes, bathing, drinking,
&amp;c. all of which might be done in half an
hour. But in the summer months, his labors are
severe. Exclusive of the above requisitions,
which are multiplied ten-fold, he has to water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the <em>tatties</em>, (or frames filled with grass,) applied
to the windward side of every house, for the
purpose of cooling the air; at that season not
only uncomfortably hot, but absolutely parching
the skin of a person not habituated to its influence.
By day-break the <em>bheesty</em> must begin
to fill the several tubs, or immense <em>nauds</em>, (pans)
of earthen-ware, placed near the house; this
being done, he brings the <em>tatties</em>, and after wetting
each thoroughly, as it lays on the ground,
places it against its respective aperture, supporting
it with props, and, during the whole
day, indeed often till mid-night, sprinkling it
in every part; occasionally replenishing the vessels,
as their contents may be expended.
Though it cannot be said to occur often, yet, in
some very dry seasons, it has been found necessary
to continue the <em>bheesties</em> at their labor
during the whole night. I recollect an instance,
in the year 1793, when the winds were, if any
thing, hotter at night than in the day time;
rendering it absolutely necessary to keep the
<em>tatties</em> up for a full week, or more; and demanding
additional <em>bheesties</em>, who performed the night
duty.</p>

<p class='c008'>All the houses in India are tarrased, not only
on the basements, but on every floor; therefore,
previous to sweeping, the <em>bheesty</em> sprinkles the
tarras slightly; thereby preventing the dust
from rising when the sweeper performs his part.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>He likewise waters the precincts of the house,
several times daily, but especially towards sun-set,
when gentlemen usually take their tea in
the open air. If going any distance, perhaps
two or three miles, in their palanquins, during
the prevalence of the hot winds, it is common for
persons of respectability to be accompanied by
their <em>bheesties</em>, who carry a small quantity of water
in their <em>mussocks</em>; therewith sprinkling the <em>tatties</em>
applied to the sides of the vehicle; the interior,
which but for this would be insufferably hot,
is thereby rendered fresh and cool. Those who
do not take <em>bheesties</em> with them, have their <em>gutta-topes</em>,
(or palanquin covers,) which are ordinarily
made of the <em>karwah</em> before described, well
soaked in water before they set out: this,
though not so effectual as the foregoing mode,
is no bad substitute.</p>

<p class='c008'>Water, when dashed out from the end of
a <em>mussock</em>, or <em>bheesty-bag</em>, would be apt to
penetrate into the interior of a palanquin; and
as its expenditure, while proceeding any distance,
should be economically managed, a very
simple device is in use, which effectually
answers every purpose; namely, the introduction
of a small rose-head, similar to those affixed to
the spouts of garden watering-pots, which being
firmly secured within the neck of the <em>mussock</em>,
by means of the leather throng always attached
to that part, divides the water more minutely,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and checks its too abundant supply; at the same
time that it causes the distribution to be more
general and equal.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Tatties</em> are made of the roots of that long grass of
which most of the jungles in India consist, and
which correspond exactly with the Guinea grass,
once so ridiculously sent to the East as a great
acquisition; the fibres are of a rusty brown
color, devious in their direction, and may be
from ten to twenty inches in length: we see
among us cloaths brushes, and carpet brooms,
made of it. The Hindostanee name is <em>kuss-kuss</em>,
and the general price may be about four rupees
per maund, (of 82 lb).</p>

<p class='c008'>The frame, in which this material is to be
enclosed, is made of split bamboo, chequered
into squares, of about four inches each way,
and in the whole sufficiently extensive to overlap
the exterior of the door, or window, to
which it is to be applied, at least six inches, or
perhaps, a foot, at the sides and above. The
<em>kuss-kuss</em> is then placed very regularly on the
bamboo frame, as it lies on the ground, in the
same manner as tiles; each layer being bound
down, under a thin slip of bamboo, extending
the full breadth of the <em>tatty</em>. The great art is
to make the <em>tatty</em> neither too thick, which would
exclude the wind; nor too thin, as it would then
let the dust pass through, without rendering the
interior sufficiently cool. I found, after much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>experiment, that a maund of <em>kuss-kuss</em>, applied
so as to cover about a hundred square feet, answered
extremely well. But it is best to have
one or two <em>tatties</em> made rather thin; so as to
apply in case of light winds: when it blows
hard, these may be applied double; one at the
back of the other. At such times, the interior
of a house will be very cool; sometimes rather
too much so; for the great evaporation caused
by the heated air’s passage through the cold
medium, produces perfect refrigeration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the western provinces, and other parts of
India, <em>tatties</em> are frequently made of a short,
prickly bush, that thrives during the hottest
months on sandy plains, especially in places
inundated during the rainy season. This shrub
is called, <em>jewassah</em>; its leaves are not unlike,
but not so numerous, nor of so deep a green, as
those of rue. It is extremely prickly, being
every where furnished with spines about the
size of a pin. When fresh, the <em>jewassah</em> is most
pleasing to the eye, and its scent is equally
agreeable; but, after the first day, its verdure
disappears, and the whole house is filled with
its leaves, and its thorns. Hence, the <em>kuss-kuss</em>,
which, when fresh, is rather fragrant, though the
scent is somewhat terraceous, is usually preferred
in making those <em>tatties</em> which roll up, so as
to be particularly applicable to palanquins, and
are called <em>cheeks</em>; wherein nothing but <em>kuss-kuss</em> is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>ever employed: where this root cannot be procured,
or when in the early part of the hot season,
little has come to market, common grass,
pared from the soil, or even small boughs,
straw, &amp;c. are occasionally used to fill between
two frames of bamboo: they answer tolerably
when well watered; but, on account of their
disposition to rot, soon become objectionable:
<em>kuss-kuss</em> will keep for years.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very few <em>puckaullies</em>, or <em>bullock-bheesties</em>, are
retained in the service of individuals; such are
usually attached to the establishments of barrack-masters,
and quarter-masters. They answer
admirably for the supply of water at the soldiers’
quarters, and at the hospitals; to which <em>tatties</em>
are allowed, at the public expence, during the
hot season. In most cases, the bullocks that
carry the water, as well as the leather bags, appertain
to the establishment, and the driver
receives only the pay of a <em>hand-bheesty</em>; where
he supplies the whole, his pay is from ten to
twelve rupees per month.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Babachy</em>, or cook, is a servant who may
fairly claim very considerable approbation, since
he prepares most sumptuous dinners, although
he never tastes any of the viands while in a
state of preparation; and is, besides, often put
to his wits to guard against the joint attacks of
dust, wind, rain, sun, and birds of prey. In a
regular, settled family, it is true he may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>every convenience afforded him; such as a substantial
and spacious kitchen, with fire-place
according to the Indian style; a range of stoves,
a scullery, apparatus of all sorts, &amp;c. &amp;c. But
when on a march, the case is widely different;
he must then turn to with his mattock, and dig
a number of holes, to receive his fuel; which is
usually green wood, or dried cow-dung; he
must make <em>choolahs</em>, or fire places, by placing
three lumps of earth, kneaded into a stiff paste,
for each <em>choolah</em>, so as to support the boiler it is
to receive; he must burn his wood to embers,
over which his meat is to be roasted, by means
of a small spit; perhaps made of slit bamboo,
but if of iron, with a crank at one end, whereby
to turn it, as it rests upon two <em>dogs</em>, or iron
spikes, driven into the ground, a few feet asunder;
he must, in all probability, kill and flay a
kid, or two or three fowls; some for curry,
others for roasting, &amp;c.; and, perhaps, after all,
he may have to turn the spit himself; occasionally
looking to the contents of the several
boilers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fixed roasting place in a permanent
kitchen is generally made of two inclined bars
of iron, about four or five feet in length, set sloping
against a wall, at an angle of perhaps forty
degrees. Each of these bars is furnished with
eight or ten hooks, in any suitable pair of which
the spit is turned by a boy: the spaces under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>them, that is to say, the triangle on each side,
are filled with masonry, so that the heat may be
retained, and the embers be kept within certain
bounds.</p>

<p class='c008'>For roasting in this manner, the embers are
divided lengthwise, leaving a vacancy, or kind
of trough, under the line of the spit, wherein a
metal platter is sometimes set, to receive the
dripping, which is returned to the meat by a
bunch of feathers, (generally those from the
wings of the fowls just killed,) tied to the end
of a short stick. This little neat, <em>cleanly</em>, and
cheap dripping-ladle, answers admirably; it being
in the power of the <em>babachy</em> to baste any
part with great precision. I know not any thing
in the culinary way, that proves more uncomfortable
to delicate stomachs than the sight of
this part of the process; unless it be the very
common practice of preparing toast, by means
of melted butter laid on either with the above
implement, or with a piece of old rag! As for
straining soup, &amp;c. through dirty clouts, that is
considered as a matter of course; therefore,
after a full conviction that it is so, and that <a id='corr233.25'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_233.25'><ins class='correction' title='he'>the</ins></a></span>
soup is well flavored, very few exceptions are
made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding such <em>unpicturesque</em> operations,
the dinner, when brought to table, looks
well, and tastes well: appetite, at that time,
supersedes daintiness, and prevents the imagination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>from travelling back to the kitchen;
though, to be sure, the number of flies at times
found in the sauces, will occasion a disposition
to enquire how they got there, and whence
they came! These obnoxious visitors rarely fail
to visit the purlieus of the <em>balachy’s</em> camp;
where they assemble in swarms; not only covering
the garbage, which usually lies but a few
paces distant, but settling on the meat, or visiting
the stew-pots, &amp;c. where they are overcome
by the heat, or fixed by the dripping, &amp;c.
Flies may, however, be picked out; but those
shoals of dust that skim during the middle of
the day, often render the whole dinner absolutely
unacceptable. I have been in situations
where, although a large table cloth was spread
over the knives, forks, &amp;c. as laid for dinner,
there has been collected near a pound of sand
underneath; while the upper cloth was really
covered full a quarter of an inch in depth:
those who have been stationed at Lucknow,
during the hot season, cannot but confirm my
assertion. This never can be altogether obviated
in moveable camps; but, when fixed for a
while, it is usual to set up mats, or <em>konauts</em>,
(which are walls of cloth, kept upright by ropes
and sticks,) on the windward side; whereby the
inconvenience may be considerably lessened:
but sometimes a <em>b’hoot</em>, or whirlwind, comes
suddenly, and not only be-grits the whole of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the cookery, but whisks away the fences, embers,
&amp;c. in an instant!</p>

<p class='c008'>The boilers in general are made in the country,
of copper, tinned; in shape not unlike
the common cast-iron pots used throughout
the North, without feet, and with the addition
of a flat rim projecting about an inch
outward, serving both to steady a kind of inverted
lid, and, as they have no handles, for
the <em>babachy</em> to apply two wet rags, wherewith
to put the vessel off, and on, the <em>choolah</em>. Tinning
is performed by persons who make a livelihood
thereby; they receiving a certain sum,
from one to two rupees per score, for the several
pieces, counting boilers, lids, &amp;c., according to
their size. The <em>kully-ghur</em>, or tinman, uses
but few utensils; he has the vessels well scoured,
and then, by means of powdered rosin, gives
the interior a coating, scarcely distinguishable
to the sight, or touch. Some use no rosin;
others employ borax; but, whatever the medium
may be, or whether there be none, the
vessel is heated sufficiently, and equally, over
embers, when the tin, being thoroughly melted,
is kept rubbing round the interior, with a large
piece of fine cotton wool, so long as any will
adhere: the vessel is then set to cool.</p>

<p class='c008'>It cannot require pointing out, that the above
mode is retained in vogue entirely by the cheapness,
and expedition, with which it is done;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>were it otherwise, its want of durability, could
not fail to give the preference to some more
permanent, and less soluble, preparation. But
it happens, that tinning can be performed in
almost every town; and, that there is rarely
occasion to have recourse thereto more than
once in two or three months; when a score,
of good sized pieces, may be done for as little
money as would be charged, by one of our
artizans, for tinning a very moderate-sized kettle.
Some gentlemen use tin boilers, sent from this
country; but, though certainly devoid of the
inconvenience, and danger, attendant upon a
want of tinning, such are highly objectionable,
in consequence of their being so soon burnt
through, or rusted, when laid by: notwithstanding
the generality of <em>babachies</em> adopt the precaution
of smearing the bottoms of most vessels,
but of these in particular, with fine clay, sufficiently
diluted to be laid on thin and smooth.
Our cooks at home might, perhaps, not do
amiss, were they to adopt that excellent plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>babachy</em> has nothing characteristic in his
apparel; he is generally more of a sloven than
of a beau, and may often be mistaken for a <em>mosaulchy</em>.
In some families, <em>mates</em>, or assistants,
are allowed, who do the drudgery, and whose
pay is often included in that of his superior;
in which case, four rupees are the common
allowance, though the poor mate seldom receives
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>more than half that sum; the cook-major adding
the residue, as a perquisite, to his own wages,
which may be stated at from six to twelve
rupees, according to ability. As in the case of
<em>kansamahs</em>, and <em>hookah-burdars</em>, a few instances
may be adduced of exorbitant salaries; but
we may generally take the single cook at eight
rupees, and the mate at four. Where there is
much work, as in taverns, &amp;c., from fifteen to
twenty rupees are sometimes given monthly to
the head <em>babachy</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Durzy</em>, or tailor, however strange it
may appear to those who never left England, is
an indispensable domestic in every part of India.
It is to be recollected, that all such branches of
servitude are there filled by males; except for
the <em>zenanah</em>, or haram, where there may be from
two to four females; all exclusively attached to
the lady. These know nothing of needle-work;
not so much as to enable their hemming a petticoat.
Under such circumstances, the only alternative
is to employ a sempster, who understands
cutting out, and making, waistcoats,
small-cloaths, pantaloons, shirts, &amp;c.: many,
indeed, can make a very tolerable coat, if furnished
with a pattern. The <em>durzy</em> is invariably
expected to be proficient in whatever relates to
the apparel of native women, as well as to be a
competent judge of the value of different kinds
of cloths made in the country; nor is it less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>necessary, that he should know the exact quantity
of materials requisite for the several parts
of dress. All this science is to be had, at the
average rate of seven or eight rupees monthly;
the <em>durzy</em> finding his own needles and threads.
<em>Durzies</em> capable of making gowns, &amp;c. for European
ladies, being scarce, and, as I have said in
speaking of <em>kansamahs</em>, much in request, double
the latter sum may always be earned by one of
moderate skill in that branch. The inferior class
of <em>durzies</em>, called <em>keemah-dozes</em>, who do no fine
work, but principally are employed in tent-making,
rarely earn more than four rupees
monthly: or, if paid by the day, not more than
three and a half.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various pretexts under which the <em>durzy</em>
obtains admission into the <em>zenanah</em>, added to the
constancy of his attendance at the house, unless
when any purchase is to be made, gives him an
admirable opportunity for carrying on intrigue;
for which the whole tribe are notorious: hence,
if any cause of suspicion appears, the <em>durzy</em> is
the first object of jealousy; when it generally
turns out, that, if not the principal, he is accessary,
as a go-between.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a tailor is immediately distinguished
among us, so is the <em>durzy</em> in India instantly ascertained
by his gait. Some are personable
men, but speedily become emaciated by debauchery;
in which their liberal wages enable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>them to indulge. Yet they are, on the whole,
excellent workmen; finishing apparel of all sorts
in a remarkably neat manner, and often fitting
with great exactness: but they are devoid of
invention; mostly following old patterns, and
rarely suggesting the smallest improvement.
The dress of a <em>durzy</em> much resembles that of a
<em>khedmutgar</em>; but, in the hot season, the former
wear no coortahs, being bare from the waist upwards;
sometimes substituting a small cap,
(worn only by Mussulmans,) for the turban,
which is usually compact and neat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Doby</em>, or washerman, is also exclusively
a domestic, washing for only one family; by
which it should be understood, that, not only
his master’s linen of every description, but the
<em>zenanah</em> apparel is given to him to wash, and to
iron. Sometimes, however, the latter operation
is performed by an <em>Istree-wallah</em>, or ironer; yet
this is rare; only taking place in very large families,
or in large towns, such as Calcutta, Madras,
&amp;c. where proximity of residence renders
such a resort convenient: none but box irons
are used; and of these a large portion are heated
by means of embers shut up in their cavities.
The <em>doby</em> who washes for a single gentleman,
will sometimes, at the risk of severe punishment,
or of being discharged, take the linen of
low Europeans, or Portugueze, in hand clandestinely:
many have, indeed, been detected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>in letting out the linen given to their charge.
Hence, it is needful to keep a watch over these
folks, who commonly take all the foul articles
every week, bringing home at that time what
they received at the former delivery. The wages
vary according to the labor; but from six to ten
rupees may be taken as the standard; the <em>doby</em>
finding soap, and every part of the apparatus,
without any demand upon, or reference to, his
employer. When an European lady is in the
family, some encrease must be made to the pay,
on account of the great additional labor; nothing
but white being worn at any time. In
such case, it is found expedient to have a small
apartment appropriated, in which the finer articles
may be got up by the lady’s maid.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual process of washing in India, is, first
to boil all the cloaths in a large earthen <em>naud</em>,
mixing plenty of soap, or ley, or sudjee, (fossile
alkali,) or wood-ashes, with the water. This
operation is called the <em>butteah</em>; the cloaths are
then well rinsed, either in a large tank, or in a
running stream, when they are again rubbed
with soap, and laid in a heap to soak. After a
few hours they are washed again, and, being
folded up into whisps, or bundles, of a convenient
size, are beaten forcibly on a board, cut
into deep transverse grooves, and placed aslant
in the water; in which the <em>doby</em> stands immersed
up to his knees. After dashing each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>bundle several times on the board, he opens and
rinses it in the water; repeating the dashing, as
though he were beating the board with a flail,
until every part of the linen appears to be duly
cleansed. If a board is not at hand, (though
every <em>doby</em> has at least one, of about four feet
long, two broad, and four inches thick, with a
stout stick wherewith a prop it,) any smooth
stone is made to answer. It should seem, that
this must be a most destructive method; but
experience proves, that the fine calicoes of India
will, even under such apparently rough usage,
wear longer than our stout linens washed in
tubs, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every <em>doby</em> has his drying lines, which are
fixed at each end to pins driven into the ground,
and then sustained by cross-sticks, on the forks
of which the ropes rest. In the rainy season,
the cloaths are hung somewhere under shelter,
where they soon dry; though not so quick as in
the summer months; during which the heaviest
articles may be dried in a few minutes. The
<em>doby’s</em> wife, (called the <em>dobin</em>,) usually assists in
every part of the process; as do also such of his
children as are of an age to be useful. This sect
is very peculiar in many instances, it, and that of
the <em>comars</em>, or potters, being the only two privileged
to ride, or even to carry burthens, upon
asses, without suffering the most ignominious
degradation: hence, those animals are jocularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>termed, ’<em>dobies’s palfreys</em>.’ The dress of the
<em>doby</em> is generally very plain, consisting of a turban,
a <em>dotee</em>, (or waist-cloth,) and a <em>chudder</em>, (or
sheet,) worn loosely over the body in cold weather.
When <em>dobies</em> are at work, their lungs aspirate
strongly, like those of paviors; which produces
a very singular effect; especially if, as is
very often the case, several of these board-thrashers
are assembled at the same piece of water.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Dobies</em> are very generally Hindus; and ought,
agreeably to the ordinary tenets of that religion,
to refrain from touching any animal substance,
except leather, when used in the construction of
shoes, and implements of war; but a particular
exception is made in favor of this <em>cast</em>, (or sect,)
who could not otherwise use soap, when made
of suet; though, by far the greater portion of
that made in Hindustan, is manufactured with
oil expressed from the sesamum.</p>

<p class='c008'>When on a march, the <em>doby</em> in each gentleman’s
service loads his cloaths, wet or dry, upon
his camels, bullocks, cart, &amp;c.: the servant’s
own apparatus being conveyed on a donkey;
which, in general, is tolerably well burthened
with the wife, or some young children, the washing-board,
its prop, the drying lines, the sticks,
box irons, &amp;c. &amp;c.; forming, in the whole, an
abundant accumulation of moveables for so small
an animal as an Hindostanee jack-ass; which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>seldom to be seen half the size of the common
breed we have in England.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <em>Mohout</em> is a person employed to feed, and to
drive, an elephant: most of this profession are
Mussulmans, and very dissipated in their conduct.
Except at particular periods, on a long
march for instance, the <em>mohout</em> has little to do;
all the drudgery that relates to bringing in fodder
on the elephant, for its own use, as well as
taking the animal to water, rubbing it down,
oiling its forehead, painting its cheeks with vermilion,
or with ochre, putting on the pads,
clearing away the dung, with a variety of such
matters, being in general done by the <em>mate</em>, or
deputy, who is often nothing more than a <em>cooly</em>,
or common laborer, employed for this especial
business, but who ultimately succeeds to the
charge of an elephant. <em>Mohouts</em> receive from
three to six rupees monthly: the lowest rates of
wages being confined to those countries where
elephants are caught; and the highest attainable
only in the service of gentlemen of rank; who
require this, as well as all other of their domestics,
to dress more correctly than such as appertain
to persons in less opulent, or less dignified, circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duty of a <em>mohout</em>, when actively employed,
is to sit upon the neck of his elephant,
bare-footed, and furnished with an instrument,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>called a <em>haunkus</em>, (or driver,) wherewith to guide
the animal. This is commonly about twenty,
or perhaps twenty-four inches in length, generally
made of iron, though some have wooden
hafts; the tip is pointed, and, about six inches
below it, is a hook, welded on to the stem,
forming nearly a semi-circle, whose diameter
may be four or five inches. At the butt of the
shaft, a ring is let through, for the purpose of
fastening the <em>haunkus</em> to a line; the other end of
which is fastened to some soft cord, about half
an inch in diameter, passing very loosely eight,
or ten, times round the elephant’s neck, and
serving, in lieu of stirrups, to keep the <em>mohout</em>
from falling over to the right or left, on any sudden
motion, as well as to retain his feet in their
due direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the elephant is to be urged forward,
the point of the <em>haunkus</em> is pressed into the back
of his head, while the <em>mohout’s</em> toes press under
both the animal’s ears: when it is to be stopped,
the <em>mohout</em> places the hook part against the
elephant’s forehead; and, throwing his weight
back, occasions considerable pain, which soon
induces to obedience: when it is to turn to the
left, the <em>mohout</em> presses the toes of his right foot
under the right ear of the elephant, at the same
time goading him about the tip of the right ear;
thereby causing the animal to turn its head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and to change its direction: to turn to the right,
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vice versâ</em></span>. When the elephant is to lie down,
in order to be laden, the <em>haunkus</em> is pressed perpendicularly
upon the crown of the head: but
most elephants, after a year or two, become very
well acquainted with the words of command;
obeying them readily, without being mounted,
or even approached.</p>

<p class='c008'>Each <em>mate</em>, or <em>cooly</em>, is generally provided
with a cutting bill, called a <em>d’how</em>, for the purpose
of lopping off the lesser branches of <em>barghuts</em>,
<em>peepuls</em>, and other trees, in common use
as fodder. An elephant will usually carry as
much of these on his back, as he can consume
in two days; but it is not customary to load
more than will last for one day, when on a
march; as it would be superfluous. Boughs, as
thick as a man’s arm, are very easily chewed by
this stupendous animal; which often uses one,
of full a hundred weight, to drive the flies from
its body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the <em>d’how</em>, each <em>mate</em> is furnished with
a spear, about six or seven feet in length,
having a long pyramidal blade, ornamented at
its point with a tassel, and armed at its other
extremity with a blunter’s pike: the former is
used to urge the animal to exertion, the <em>mate</em>
goading his hind quarters; the latter serves to
stick the implement upright in the ground, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>to press upon the elephant’s arm while the load
is putting on, or the rider ascending into the
howdah.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of the <em>mohout</em> is, in most points,
similar to that of the <em>khedmutgar</em>; and that of
the <em>mate</em> is, if any thing, but little better than
the ordinary costume of poor laborers, though
their pay may be rated from three to four rupees
per month: in those provinces where elephants
are caught, provisions are extremely cheap;
there, few <em>mates</em> receive more than a rupee
and a half, or two rupees. The occupation of a
<em>mohout</em> is considered by no means conducive to
longevity; a premature decrepitude generally
disqualifies after a few years of service. This is
supposed to arise from the motion of the elephant;
but may, perhaps very justly, be attributed
to the too great intervals of leisure, which
are generally passed in conviviality.</p>

<p class='c008'>The health of a <em>Surwan</em>, or camel-driver, is
yet more subject to early decay, than that of a
<em>mohout</em>: the motion of this animal being most
oppressively severe; causing such a vibration of
the loins as is attended with great pain, and
often with suppression of urine, together with
tenesmus, especially in tender persons not accustomed
thereto. It is said to be less severe
when trotting, than when walking: the former
I never tried; being perfectly satisfied with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span><em>gentle ambulation</em>, which made every joint of
my vertebræ crack at the time, and ache for
some hours after. The dress of this class resembles
that of a <em>mosaulchy</em> of the superior order; the
pay may be from four to five rupees, if in charge
of only two camels; but, if three, it is usual to
allow a rupee more. The duty consists in seeing
the camels fed properly, for which purpose
the <em>surwan</em> proceeds, every second or third day,
to some village, for chaff of various kinds: the
usual quantity of <em>gram</em>, (a kind of pulse wherewith
laboring cattle are fed,) is given, part in the
morning, and part in the evening; or perhaps
all at the latter time: three <em>seers</em>, equal to about
six pounds, are considered good keep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Camels being rarely very tractable, especially
when lustful, must be approached with great
caution: their bite is dreadful, not only from the
size of the mouth and the strength of the jaw,
as well as the form of the tushes, but because
they rarely quit their hold. It often happens
that the same camel kills several <em>surwans</em>: probably,
if there were lords of the manor to claim
such beasts as deodands, fewer accidents would
happen. The only mode, hitherto ascertained,
of governing these vicious animals, is, by boring
a hole in the nostril, and passing through it,
from within, a piece of tough wood, with a knob
about as large as a nutmeg. A strong piece of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>line is then fastened to the outer extremity of
the wood, that, on being pulled, causes the
camel to lie down at pleasure. This contrivance,
which is called <em>naukell</em>, keeps him in tolerable
order; though it is prudent to have a stout
bludgeon, in case of any attempt to seize. When
camels are very vicious, it is common to cut off
their noses, so far as the gristle extends: this
privation is supposed to do much good; but I
have seen numberless instances wherein it totally
failed; while, on the other hand, <a id='corr253.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='it is'>it</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_253.11'><ins class='correction' title='it is'>it</ins></a></span> greatly depreciated;
since few would like to purchase
one bearing so obvious a type of treachery.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good <em>surwan</em> will always distinguish himself
by the order of his cattle, by their freedom
from injuries in consequence of galling under
the saddle, and especially by the compact manner
in which he places whatever burthen is to be
carried. This should never exceed six maunds
of 82lb each; though the Company require, in
all their contracts, that the camels furnished for
their service should carry much more. Possibly,
on a soil suited to the camel’s foot, he may,
on emergency, carry as far as eight maunds,
equal to no less than 656lb; but such must not
be expected to last. If the soil is boggy, half
that weight will be found sufficient; especially
where slippery; for, when overladen, the animal
will, in such places, be very subject to
ruin; his hind legs sliding asunder, so as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>bring the pelvis to the ground: this, which is
termed ‘splitting,’ renders him unable to rise,
or, if raised, to proceed, in consequence of the
violent injury sustained. On such an occasion
the animal’s throat is cut by some good Mussulman,
who, as he performs that operation, and
during the time the blood is flowing, recites a
prayer and benediction, whereby the meat,
which is esteemed a great delicacy, is sanctified,
and may be eaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Syce</em>, or groom, attends but one horse,
and has attached to him an under servant, whose
business it is to provide grass for fodder, and to
do various jobs relating to cleanliness, &amp;c.:
this may be looked upon as the extent of duty
the latter has to perform while stationary; but,
when marching, the assistant, or, as he is called,
the <em>Gaus-kot</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> grass-cutter,) has to carry the
pickets, headstall, head and heel ropes, curry-combs,
cloathing, &amp;c. &amp;c. to the next place of
encampment. The labor is certainly severe,
but is undergone, with tolerable alacrity, under
the hope of one day succeeding to the post of <em>syce</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In every country a good groom is invaluable;
but if any where more particularly enhanced, it
certainly is in India: the horses there being invariably
high spirited, from want of castration,
and often becoming, under the least provocation,
or licence, incorrigibly vicious. There we
see gentlemen, when mounted, afraid to approach
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>each other within ten or twelve yards, lest their
horses should begin fighting: some few have,
indeed, been tempted, by the supposed passiveness
of their respective steeds, to ride boot to
boot; but rarely without experiencing some
dreadful misfortune; many legs having been
thus broken! Although much may depend
upon the natural temper of a horse, still there
will remain much in the power of the <em>syce</em>. If
he be timid, and the animal spirited, the affair
is soon over, by the latter gaining such an ascendancy
as to render him ungovernable. Being
once let loose, and a mare within sight, or scent,
away goes the steed, completely disqualified for
future saddling.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is inconceivable what control some <em>syces</em>
obtain over their horses, which will allow the
approach of no others. This, though it may be
an admirable mode of temporizing with a vicious
beast, is often attended with most ludicrous, or
rather most distressing, circumstances; it being
very common to see persons sitting on horses
from which they dare not alight, until their own
<em>syces</em> may arrive, and, by securing the head,
with a <em>baug-door</em>, (or leading-halter,) grant master
leave to quit the saddle. This occurs so frequently
as to cause no surprize; though it often
excites some merriment, not always pleasing to
the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a person falls from his horse, the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>troop separate, lest the stray animal should
attack them: in such case, two or three active
<em>syces</em> may prevent mischief; but, few will attempt
to catch a horse whose character for gentleness
is not established. Every <em>syce</em> is provided
with a strong cotton cord, rather thicker
than a stout window line, of several yards long,
which he fastens to the left cheek of the bit
when leading, and does not loosen until his
master has mounted; when, by drawing a slip
knot, the animal is liberated from the groom’s
control.</p>

<p class='c008'>In general, the line (<em>baug-door</em>) is affixed before
dismounting: a neglect of that precaution
is frequently attended with unpleasant consequences;
for, to say the least, the horse will in
all probability gallop away to his stable, which
may be some miles distant; leaving his incautious
rider to walk after him; not always very
cool, either in regard to the weather, or to his
own state of mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the immense number of
gad-flies to be seen at all times of the year, each
<em>syce</em> carries a whisk, made by fastening horse-hair
to a short stick, commonly lacquered in
rings of alternate colors. This implement, with
which the flies are driven away, is called a
<em>chowry</em>, and may cost about sixpence, or eight-pence.
A small sheet of <em>karwah</em>, either double,
or single, is usually thrown over the <em>syce’s</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>shoulder, or fastened around his waist, before he
sets off to accompany his master: this is carried
to lay over the horse’s back, so soon as given in
charge to the groom, to prevent the accession of
dry-gripes; to which the animal would be subjected,
if much heated, but for that precaution,
added to walking him about gently until perfectly
cool. Hence it will be seen, that no gentleman
ever rides unless accompanied by his
groom; many of whom run remarkably fast,
keeping up for many miles with a gig going at a
smart pace: by habit, they become long-winded,
and capable of enduring great fatigue. The
dress of a <em>syce</em>, taken generally, is a medium
between the <em>khedmutgar</em> and the <em>mosaulchy</em>; while
that of the <em>gaus-kot</em> is rarely better than that of a
common laborer. The former receives from four
to six rupees per month; five being the general
rate: the latter usually has three, when paid independently
of the <em>syce</em>; but when through his
hands, a small deduction is often made; to
resist which would lead to discharge, either
peremptorily, or by the imputation of some neglect,
&amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The grass-cutter is always expected to provide
a net for carrying a large bundle of fodder,
and a kind of paring instrument, called a <em>koorpah</em>,
wherewith to cut the grass, about half an
inch under the surface of the soil: the upper
part of the root being considered extremely nourishing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>No hay is ever seen in India; nor
would it answer that purpose nearly so well as
the common expedient of paring it for daily
consumption. The Maharrattahs, it is true,
make a coarse kind of hay, wherewith to feed
their large bodies of horse at certain seasons;
but the condition of their cattle in general by no
means recommends such a measure in private
studs. Nevertheless, that practice has its advantages,
for while our cavalry horses would
starve for want of green, or succulent fodder, the
less delicate Maharrattah charger plucks at any
old thatch with great readiness; and even on
such diet will perform wonders. I have always
thought that our public cattle were too highly
pampered; at least, that the mode of feeding
them by no means corresponded with that ready
adoption of any kind of coarse foraging, which
might become necessary under the most ordinary
circumstances of a campaign: a pig will
gradually become dainty, and rather starve than
return to its former coarse provision. The practice
of soaking <em>gram</em> for cavalry horses, is peculiarly
objectionable; as not only causing them
to expect it at all times, even when water
(much less soaking-pots) cannot be had in any
quantity; but inducing most horses to swallow
the grains whole, without mastication. In my
humble opinion, the whole of the grain supplied
to cavalry horses ought to be reduced to a coarse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>meal, mixed with hay, and straw, in equal
quantities, cut very fine in a chaff-trough.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be readily supposed, that when a camp
has been settled for a few days, on even the
most luxuriant verdure, the whole must disappear:
it, however, speedily springs again after
the first fall of rain, presenting a beautiful light-colored
blade, very small, and of rapid growth.
The kind of grass prepared for horses, is the
<em>doob</em>, or <em>sun-grass</em>, nearly corresponding with
our fine creeping-bent. This should be well
beat with a stick, and be washed before used;
if kept for a day or two in an airy place, it is
supposed to be more wholesome, than when given
immediately after being cut, as is generally
done. The <em>doob</em> is not to be found every
where; but, in the low countries about Dacca,
Mahomedpoor, &amp;c. where the inundation is
general during near three months every year,
this grass abounds; attaining to a prodigious
luxuriance! I have often seen it full two feet
and a half high, absolutely matting the ground.
Cattle are turned into it promiscuously, and
never fail to thrive. It appears curious, that in
a part where, during the rains, nothing is to be
seen of the soil; the little villages built on eminences
being the only discernible objects, if we
except the tops of large trees staring out of the
water; no provision should be made for the
maintenance of the cattle; which, at such times,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>depend entirely on what can be drawn up by
means of forked poles, from, perhaps, a depth
of twenty feet. This green food, highly impregnated
with moisture, surely cannot be wholesome
at such a season for these poor animals,
which are then cooped up in the hundreds of
boats that surround every village! Whereas, if
the <em>doob</em>, such as I have described, were to be
cut, and stacked in the month of February,
when it is in high perfection, and the atmosphere
moderately warm, there might certainly
be provided a more appropriate, and less hazardous,
species of fodder. But the truth is, that
cattle are, in every part of India, left, so long as
possible, to shift for themselves: and this, notwithstanding
that a load of the finest hay in the
world might be made in the low countries for
about half-a-crown; even admitting that labor
were paid for!</p>

<p class='c008'>It gives me very great pleasure to observe, in
the Gentleman’s Magazine, for February, 1809,
that a grass has been discovered in Ireland,
called the <em>fiorin</em>, which perfectly corresponds
with the <em>doob</em> of Hindustan. This invaluable
plant stands the severest cold of Iceland, as well
as it does the scorching heats of tropical summers.
In the latter instance, the verdure certainly
disappears; but the root remains unimpaired,
and abounds with succulence. I feel
no hesitation in asserting, that if the <em>fiorin</em> be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>what it is described, namely, the <em>doob</em> of Hindostan,
it will prove an invaluable acquisition
to the British agriculturist. A rich grass that
will stand either heat or cold, or immersion
for many successive months, cannot fail to
abridge our catalogue of Georgic desiderata.
The <em>doob</em> is rarely sown in India; but, after
being cut below the surface by the tool in
common use among grass-cutters, called a <em>koorpah</em>,
is chopped with a hatchet into pieces about
two or three inches in length, when, being mixed
with mud, it is plastered on the surface of the
plot where it is intended to remain; the plot
being previously saturated with water. In a
very few days, the <em>doob</em> will be seen to vegetate,
especially if care be taken to keep the mud
moist for a short time. This grass is likewise
well suited for transplanting, by which operation
very large plots are sometimes turfed.
The stems all throw out roots at every joint
that is suffered to touch the ground; but when
very thick, and abundant, it is disposed to
tower and spindle, not unlike our pink and carnation
plants. If set in small tufts, at a foot
asunder, they will soon cover the surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Mauly</em>, or gardener, next claims attention.
The dress of this servant, unless he be at
the head of a large establishment, is scarcely
better than that of a common laborer; nor are
the wages much higher; four rupees being a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>very common rate, though sometimes as much
as six, or seven, are given to men of superior
ability, that understand some particular culture
of moment to the employer. Those who act
under the <em>maully</em> are, for the most part, <em>bildars</em>,
hired by the day, probably at five or six pice,
equal to about two rupees and a half monthly.
These <em>bildars</em> work with a kind of mattock,
called a <em>phourah</em>, consisting of a blade, about as
large as that of a common garden-spade, furnished
with a very strong eye at the top, rivetted
to the blade, and set on so as to give the
handle a direction of about 70° from the plane of
the blade, which is slightly curved inwards.
The handle may be about thirty inches in length,
and is driven nearly through the eye, where it
is occasionally wedged, to keep the blade from
turning upon it; as would be the case, on account
of the eye being round, were it not made
very tight. While working with a <em>phourah</em>, the
<em>bildar</em> stands in the same position as if using
a pick-axe: throwing up whatever soil may accumulate
at each stroke. When the tool is new,
much may be lifted in this manner; but when
worn down nearly to the eye, the most active
laborer cannot effect much more than might be
done by an ordinary bean-hoe. Those <em>maullies</em>
who serve gentlemen, are usually provided with
rakes and hoes; but, in any other situation,
they content themselves with using short iron
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>spuds, set into wooden handles, the stem being
cranked, and the whole rarely exceeding eighteen
inches in length: with these they beat the clods
to pieces, and level the surface admirably: but,
of course, not so quickly as our gardeners.
With the same kind of tool, though of a smaller
size, they dig up weeds; keeping the garden
remarkably clean; and, under proper observation,
raising an immense quantity of vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would surprize an European to see with
what precision <em>maullies</em> sow and cover their
seeds; the seasons for which they are perfectly
acquainted with, even though the greater portion
of the horticultural produce in that quarter
consists of exotics: this is the more remarkable,
because there is no book of gardening extant in
the Hindui language; and if there were, the
chances would be, at least a thousand to one,
that the <em>maully</em> could not read it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greater part of the manure used in gardens
is known by the name of <em>kallah-matty</em>,
(<i>i.e.</i> black-earth,) and is collected from such
places as are set apart for the reception of filth
of all sorts. Horse-dung, cow-dung, &amp;c. are
generally too much valued to be appropriated to
the soil: these are almost invariably preserved
carefully; and, being made into a mass, are
formed into cakes, between the hands, about the
size of a plate; while moist, they are stuck up
against some wall exposed to the sun; where,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>in a day or two, they become thoroughly dry,
and make an excellent kind of fuel, burning very
like good peats. These <em>guttees</em>, as they are
called, are generally prepared by the <em>syce’s</em> wife,
and kept in a stack for culinary purposes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The gardens of Europeans are, with few exceptions,
laid out much in the same way as our
kitchen-gardens; having one main walk, with a
few ramifications and parallels, all of which are
covered with <em>soorkee</em>, or brick-dust; though
sometimes, where gravel, or rather shingle, can
be found, it is used in preference. The whole
area is intersected by little channels made of
earth, or perhaps lined with semi-circular tiles,
whereby water is conveyed to every part at
pleasure. The peculiar gratification afforded to
the eye, and, indeed, to the feelings, by the
proximity of perpetual verdure, in a country
where, for many months together, scarcely a
green spot is to be seen, induces most persons,
when laying down a garden, to appropriate such
a piece of ground as may be in view, to the
formation of a grass-plot. This is refreshed every
third or fourth day by laying on water from the
well, always made on some more elevated spot,
so as to command every part to which the irrigation
is to extend. The <em>doob</em> is invariably selected
for this purpose; and, in consequence of
its numerous seeds, as well as owing to the cool
shelter it affords, never fails to attract great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>numbers of ants, of various colors and sizes; all
of which are a perfect nuisance throughout the
East. Gentlemen who rear turkies, find from
experience, that few can be brought up except
where such grass-plots exist; and where shade,
and water, are at hand for the birds to avail
themselves of at pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of our garden esculents thrive in India;
cabbages, cauliflowers, lettuces, celery, beets,
carrots, turnips, peas, cucumbers, French beans,
radishes, potatoes, &amp;c. are cultivated in abundance;
together with capsicums, love-apples,
egg-plants, gourds of various kinds, calavanses,
yams, sweet potatoes, and hundreds of the indigenous
tribe. The common fruits are guavas,
peaches, nectarines, grapes, a few apples, but
no pears, melons of sorts, pine-apples, mangoes,
oranges, citrons, limes, pomegranates,
byres of a very huge kind, comringahs, (or
winged apples,) currindahs, and, in general,
most of the tropical fruits. Within the last
twenty years, very considerable additions have
been made by the introduction of various trees,
and also of gardeners, from China: the former
have thriven admirably; while, to the latter we
are indebted for many valuable practices, common
among that industrious people, and which
promise to contribute greatly to the perfection of
Asiatic horticulture. The best of <em>maullies</em> could
not be ranked with the least capable among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>Chinese gardeners; though it cannot be denied,
that they possess many strong recommendations;
and are not a little proud of any improvements,
or novelties, committed to their management.
In the art of irrigation they cannot be surpassed.
That indispensable operation is performed, in
most instances, by drawing water from a narrow
well, into a cistern, or hollow, at its edge;
whence, by means of the channels before described,
each bed receives the necessary supply
of moisture. A pair of very small oxen, worth
about twelve or fifteen shilling’s each, suffice to
draw up a <em>moot</em>, or leather bag, containing from
twenty-five to thirty gallons.</p>

<p class='c008'>In general, a small hut is erected in the garden
for the accommodation of the <em>maully</em>; most
of whose operations are performed after sun-set:
especially that of laying on water, and the setting
of plants. Rat-catching is also an object of
importance, and most successfully followed during
moon-light nights; when those large black
rats, called <em>bandycoots</em>, equalling most cats in
bulk, are often speared, as they ramble among the
cucumber and melon beds, wherein they make
prodigious havoc. Nor is there any deficiency
of other sorts, or sizes, of rats: they are to be
found both in immense numbers, and in every
variety; but the large Norway rat is most abundant.
I never saw, nor heard of a mole in the
country: most probably the soil does not suit;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>as it becomes so hard and dry during the hot
season.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Aub-dar</em>, or water-cooler, is scarcely less
indispensable than the cook; for, without the
exercise of his art, all the delicacies of the table
would be of no value. Hot wine, and hot water,
are by no means acceptable to those who inhale
so rarefied an atmosphere; and who generally
prefer such made-dishes as abound in spice. It
is true, that, sometimes, a <em>khedmutgar</em>, or a
<em>bearer</em>, may be found, capable of cooling liquors
nearly as well as <em>aub-dars</em> of the lower class;
but such are rare, and cannot always be depended
upon. In saying this, I do not mean to
attribute the success of even the best qualified
<em>aub-dar</em> to any chemical knowledge, or to much
comprehension of the manner, or moment, in
which the refrigeration takes place: far from
it; they are all the children of imitation, and by
keeping within certain parallels, wide enough
asunder, hit upon their object; though not
without much loss of materials, as well as of
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The apparatus necessary for the operations of
this servant, consist of a large pewter vessel,
near half an inch in thickness, and in its form
not unlike a very thick Cheshire cheese, of
which the edges are much rounded off. At the
top, a circular aperture, about a foot in diameter,
is left, for the introduction of two pewter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>flasks, (each containing about a pint and a half,)
of a spherical form, and furnished with long narrow
necks, nearly cylindrical, about ten inches
in length, and fitted with caps, of the same
metal, that come down about an inch and a half,
every where close. The great bason just described
is called a <em>taus</em>, and the flasks are called
<em>soories</em>. When water is to be cooled, about a
gallon is put into the <em>taus</em>; which, by means of
a small wooden frame, made for the purpose, or,
for want of it, a few bricks, &amp;c. is sloped a little,
that the water may lie more towards one
side: a handful or two of salt-petre is then put
in, and the <em>soories</em>, being about two thirds filled
with the water to be drank, are moved about in
the <em>taus</em>, one in each hand, while the salt-petre
is dissolving. So soon as that is effected, which
is usually in two or three minutes, the <em>soories</em>
are laid at rest; their necks projecting out at
the opposite side of the aperture, the sphere
part being immersed, and a wet cloth laid over
the whole of the opening: in that manner the
intense cold, generated by the solution, acts
upon the water within the <em>soories</em>; so effectually
indeed, in many instances, as to be unpleasantly
condensed. As to cracking the glasses, that is
extremely common, but is rather to be imputed
to their being somewhat heated by the atmosphere;
when the cold water, being suddenly
poured in, causes nine in ten, so acted upon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>to fly. Wine is always cooled in the common
glass bottle wherein it is drawn from the cask,
and so soon as taken from the <em>taus</em>, which may
be in about five minutes after being left at rest,
is covered with a petticoat made of <em>karwah</em>, or
other cloth, well wetted. Being placed in a
stand made of turned wood, to receive the
drippings, the bottle is placed on the table;
usually stopped with a silver-mounted cork.
Decanters are rarely used in any part of India;
both because they are extremely subject to crack,
and, that they certainly do not keep wine so
cool as the common glass bottles do.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of the <em>aub-dar</em> generally resembles
that of the <em>khedmutgar</em>, and his wages may rank
with the superior classes serving in that capacity:
he has, in general, some perquisites, both
in charging for more salt-petre than is used, and
from the sale of the salt-petre water; which,
throughout Calcutta, and in many other places,
is carefully preserved in large jars, to be sold to
persons who boil it down for the purpose of producing
the nitre in a more purified state. <em>Aub-dars</em>
should not be allowed to cool water within
the house; the salt-petre doing considerable
injury to the walls, from which it cannot possibly
be extracted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever a gentleman dines, thither his <em>aub-dar</em>
repairs, in time to have water cooled as the
dinner is served up: when a large party are assembled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>it is curious to see perhaps two dozens
of these servants, laboring at their profession
under the shade of the house, and making a
noise not very dissimilar to the quick motion of
a stone-saw. Custom occasions it to pass unheeded,
unless so far as relates to the anticipation
of a cool draught. It should be remarked,
that water is the common beverage: the smallest
hole in the bottom of a <em>soories</em> utterly spoils it;
therefore the defect must be well closed with
solder. All the wine used at the table is cooled
by the host’s own servant; though, when any
particularly famous <em>aub-dar</em> is in attendance, he
is often asked to exert his skill: a request always
complied with, in a manner fully exhibiting
that vanity pervades this, as well as other
classes of mortals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Compadore</em>, or <em>Kurz-burdar</em>, or <em>Butler-konnah-sircar</em>,
are all designations for the same
individual, who acts as purveyor, sometimes
under the orders of the master, but more generally
of the <em>kansamah</em>, who never fails to participate
of the profits made by over-charges, and
by the receipt of <em>dustooree</em>, (or customary gift,)
from the venders of whatever may be provided
for domestic, consumption. This servant may
be considered as appertaining to the order of
<em>sircars</em>, of which he should possess all the cunning,
the smooth tongue, the audacious and
persevering effrontery, when maintaining a palpable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>lie, together with that obsequiousness
which should conciliate master, and make him
believe it! Without these, the <em>compadore</em> could
never thrive. The pay of such a rogue is generally
about four, or, at the utmost, five, rupees per
mensem; but that is comparatively no object, in
any family where some hundreds are spent in
house-keeping. In order to aid the deception, he
invariably dresses so very meanly, as to claim our
commiseration in behalf of his apparent poverty:
while, at the same time, it is probable that, one
way or other, he contrives to retain about an eighth
part of the money entrusted to his disbursement.
The usual custom is, for the <em>kansamah</em> to enquire,
during the evening, what is to be done in
the culinary department on the succeeding day:
if the family dine abroad, no directions are
necessary; otherwise, fish, flesh, and fowl must
be laid in. As the best of the market is between
day-light and sun-rise, after which all the prime
articles will have disappeared, the <em>compadore</em>
must proceed with his catalogue of desiderata,
attended by one or two under-servants, (<em>mosaulchies</em>,
<em>kalashies</em>, &amp;c.) to purchase the required
articles. No time must be lost in returning home,
at least during the hot months; for such is the
rapid progress towards putrefaction, that I have
more than once seen veal, which had been killed
after midnight, become perfectly offensive in ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>hours, notwithstanding every possible precaution
was taken to keep it cool.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be understood, that a <em>compadore</em> must,
of necessity, be a good accountant; like the <em>sircar</em>,
he is well versed in fractions, and carries his
computations down to a single <em>gundah</em> of <em>cowries</em>,
(<i>i.e.</i> four <em>Blackamoors’ teeth</em>). This minuteness
passes with many for honesty; but by far the
greater part of house-keepers either put those very
small parts out of the question, (regardless of the
old saying, that, ‘if the pence are well taken care
of, they will nourish the shillings; while the
pounds acquire strength to take care of themselves,’)
or they content themselves with the
reflection, that the accounts are correctly taken,
without even examining their contents. Every
charge thus becomes sanctioned when committed
to paper; therefore each knave is anxious to
have his items noted, under the full conviction,
that, thenceforth, they are beyond the probability,
if not the possibility, of refutation. But
such will never be effected, unless a few of the
filberts are, according to the old fable, dropped
into the <em>compadore’s</em> bag; so as to diminish the
bulk of the hand, and to allow its retiring with
the remainder of the booty. Not a <em>cowrie</em> can
stir without the <em>compadore’s</em> knowledge! Under
the plea of fidelity to his employer, he insists
upon being privy to every disbursement; never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>failing to preach up his own vigilance; and
(which is the best of the joke,) making a point
of attending every morning with his hands full of
papers, and his ink-pot, &amp;c., in readiness to give
a detail of the expences of the preceding day;
though he perfectly knows that detail is never
attended to.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us not suppose that such deception is
local: in other, or in various, forms, we may find
it throughout the world. Some, who boast of
the excellence of English menials, &amp;c. may,
perhaps, affect to believe them to be less infected
with such knavery as is above displayed; but an
appeal to that too correct history of the times,
yclep’d ‘The Newgate Kalendar,’ must remove
every doubt of the instability of such an exemption;
and should assure us, that, whenever temptation
solicits, and opportunity favors, few, of
any sect, color, or rank, have the virtue to resist,
provided the object be proportioned to the risk!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Hirkarah</em> was, formerly, a servant used
solely for carrying expresses, or such letters, messages,
&amp;c. as were to be sent beyond the circle
of ordinary, or daily, communication: he was,
in fact, what is now commonly called a <em>cossid</em>.
We have retained, however, the designation of
<em>dawk-hirkarahs</em> for those who convey the <em>dawks</em>,
or posts. In every other instance, the duty of
the <em>hirkarah</em>, as an attendant upon a gentleman
in office, &amp;c. is similar to that of the <em>peon</em>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span><em>piada</em>, or running footman. His pay is generally
the same; but the former usually bears a lacquered
walking-stick, armed at its extremity with a
square spike, the ferule of which is ornamented
with dark-colored fringe, or tassels. This stick
is carried over the shoulder, and is the only distinction
between the <em>hirkarah</em> and the <em>peon</em>:
but, though the latter has no such insignia, he
frequently claims precedence, causing the <em>hirkarah</em>
to precede him in the retinue, while attending
their employer’s palanquin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Both these servants, whose capacities are now
perfectly blended, when serving Europeans at
least, receive from four to five rupees monthly.
In every respect, beyond the foregoing exceptions,
they dress much the same as <em>khedmutgars</em>,
but generally have turbans and <em>cummer-bunds</em> of
the same color, by way of livery; and, when in
the employ of great merchants, agents, and especially
under the principal officers of the government,
wear belts of colored broad-cloth, with
metal breast-plates; bearing either the initials, or
the arms, of their employers, or inscriptions stating
the offices to which they appertain. The
generality of such inscriptions have the English
designation in the centre, with a translation in
the Persian, or the Bengallee, language, (perhaps
both,) around, on the margin, or <em>vice versâ</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many most extraordinary journies have been
made by <em>hirkarahs</em>: instances have been adduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>of their travelling full a hundred miles in
the four and twenty hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Duftoree</em>, or office-keeper, attends solely
to those general matters in an office, which do
not come within the notice of the <em>crannies</em>, or
clerks; such, for instance, as making pens,
keeping the ink-stands in order, ruling account
books, and perhaps binding them, preparing and
trimming the lights, setting pen-knives, together
with a great variety of little jobs, easily performed
by an individual allotted thereto, but
trenching deeply on the occupations of those engaged
in more connected and important business.
The pay of the <em>duftoree</em> may be from four to six
rupees monthly; though a few may receive
rather more; but such is unusual. The dress
depends on the <em>cast</em> of the individual: if he be
a Mussulman, it will correspond, in some measure,
with that of the <em>khedmutgar</em>; but, if a
Hindu, it will, probably, assimilate with that of
the <em>cranny</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Fraush</em>, or furniture-keeper, is generally
a Mussulman, and receives about four or five
rupees monthly: his dress corresponding with
that of a first-rate <em>mosaulchy</em>, or an inferior <em>khedmutgar</em>.
The duty of this menial, among Europeans,
consists chiefly in cleaning the furniture,
putting up, or taking down beds, (which, in
India, is always effected without the aid of a
carpenter,) beating carpets, preparing and trimming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>the lights, opening and shutting the doors
for guests, handing chairs, setting tables for meals,
together with a variety of minutiæ of a similar
description. Among the natives, the office comprehends
far more laborious employments, among
which the arrangement of tents may be adduced:
in this they aid the <em>kalashies</em>, or tent-men, reserving
to themselves the performance of whatever
relates to the interior. According to the
account of Abu Fazil, who wrote regarding the
establishment of the Emperor Akber, that monarch
retained no less than one thousand <em>fraushes</em>,
for the purpose of attending his encampments, or
parties of pleasure. These, however numerous,
must have had plenty to do; for we find that ‘the
equipage, on such occasions, consisted of 1000
elephants, 500 camels, 400 carts, and 1000 men,
escorted by 500 cavalry. There were employed
in this service 1000 <em>fraushes</em>, 500 pioneers, 100
water-carriers, 50 carpenters, 50 tent-makers,
50 link-men, 30 workers in leather, and 150
sweepers.’ The number of large tents was prodigious;
but some idea may be entertained of
their amount, when it is stated, that the royal
precinct was enclosed by <em>konauts</em> (walls of cloth)
eight feet high; and, in the whole, nearly two
miles in length! Such a display in this country,
would attract half the population to witness its
enormity!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Mater</em>, or sweeper, is considered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>lowest menial in every family: his <em>cast</em> is held
in execration, on account of the filthiness of
his occupations. There are, nevertheless, various
stages, or classes, even among these abhorred
people; of which the <em>hullalcore</em> may be
considered the lowest, while the <em>loll-baygies</em>
assume the upper rank of infamy. But, however
much they may arrogate to themselves, in
consequence of such distinctions of <em>cast</em>, all are
considered, by both Hindus and Mussulmans,
to be equally impure, alike polluting whatever
they touch. Hence, it would be considered the
height of disrespect, were a <em>mater</em>, in the service
of a native gentleman, to handle any part of his
master’s raiment, or to step on the carpet intended
for his master’s seat: as to touching his
cooking utensils, &amp;c. that would be an unpardonable
offence, and subject the delinquent, not
simply to private, but to public, castigation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hair, or birch, brooms are never seen in India:
there the instrument for sweeping, called a <em>jarroo</em>,
is made of bamboo, split to the size of a wheat
straw, about thirty inches long, and tied together
very firmly, for about six or eight inches
at one end; forming a bundle of, perhaps two
inches and a half in diameter. This instrument
is furnished by the <em>mater</em>, who generally receives
three, or sometimes four, rupees monthly.
The dress corresponds in general with that of a
decent <em>cooly</em>, (or laborer;) but some wear a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>short <em>coortah</em>, and take a little pride in this particular.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>mater</em> is generally at little expence for
provisions; he being the only servant that may,
according to his tenets, partake of what has
been served up at the table of any person,
whether European, or native, not of his own
sect. In this, the <em>matranny</em>, or female sweeper,
whose duties are exactly the same, but usually
confined to the women’s apartments, must be
included. The latter is, however, in general
far more sober, cleanly, and dainty, than the
male sweeper. In such a climate, it is of the
highest importance that all filth should be
speedily removed: therefore it is established as
a custom, that the privy should be cleansed so
soon as soiled: the <em>mater</em> attending for that
purpose, with his <em>jarroo</em>, and a <em>tickra</em>, or piece
of broken earthen-ware, into which he sweeps
away the ordure. This operation is facilitated
by a slight layer of grass placed below the seat,
which is usually of masonry. Wooden seats are
highly objectionable; both on account of being
subject to collect filth, and because they harbour
centipedes, scorpions, &amp;c. Many very ludicrous
accidents used to happen, some thirty
years back, before a reform was made in the
construction of these conveniences; which are
now on an admirable plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a dog is kept, and that there is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>occasion for retaining a professed <em>dooreah</em>, or
dog-keeper, the <em>mater</em> is always expected to
dress its victuals, and to supply it with such
refuse from the table, as he may not deem
worthy his own acceptance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Dooreah</em>, though properly an out-door
servant, residing at the <em>dooreah-konnah</em>, or
kennel, occasionally officiates as <em>mater</em>, performing
all the duties of that menial; but this
is rarely done with good will; <em>dooreahs</em>, though
of a <em>cast</em> held equally in abomination with the
ordinary sweeper, by persons of a different
persuasion, invariably considering themselves
to be far superior thereto. Although confined
to one occupation, in general, a <em>dooreah</em>
can have very little knowledge of its duties,
beyond the mere mechanical routine of dressing
a little rice, and meat, for the dogs, and taking
them out for an airing. He is usually provided
with a short whip, consisting of a thong, or
two, of raw hide, fastened to a piece of small
bamboo; with this he corrects the animals under
his charge, the number of which necessarily
varies according to their size.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus, a brace of greyhounds, or, at the most,
a leash, are considered as many as a <em>dooreah</em>
should lead out; while of small dogs, it is
common to see him surrounded by seven or
eight. Each dog has a collar, to which a strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>metal ring is sewed very firmly: this serves to
fasten a piece of stout cord, the other end of
which is looped, so as to pass over the <em>dooreah’s</em>
hand, and to sit round his wrist; in general,
the whole are led by the left hand, the right
exercising the whip. The dress of this servant
mostly resembles that of the <em>mosaulchy</em>:
their pay is also much on a par.</p>

<p class='c008'>The manner of preparing victuals for dogs is
simple: the <em>dooreah</em>, being provided with a
large earthen pot, proportioned to the quantity
of provision to be boiled, puts in the meat, cut
very small, the rice, some turmeric reduced to
a pulp, some <em>ghee</em>, or granulated butter, some
salt, and abundance of water. The pot is placed
on a <em>choolah</em>, or stove, and its contents are stirred
until they are sufficiently boiled, when they
are taken out; the water being first drained off
into a vessel, and the more solid contents spread
upon a mat to cool. Each dog is led out to separate
picket, always in the ground for that purpose,
and there tied; so that he cannot quarrel
with his neighbours. A parcel of old earthen
vessels, every where abounding, are collected
for the purpose of receiving each dog’s mess:
the meat and rice are first allotted among them,
according to bulk, and the gravy afterwards
added. Each then receives his portion; though
not without exhibiting, both by vociferation and
greediness, how eager he is to obtain his meal.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>In this manner, dogs are usually fed night and
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The business of a <em>Kalashy</em> is, properly speaking,
confined either to what relates to camp-equipage,
or to the management of the sails,
and rigging, on board a <em>budjrow</em>. In the former
instance, he is expected to understand how to
set up tents of every description; to pack, and
unpack; to load and unload: to make tent-pins;
to sew the <em>taut</em> (or canvas bags,) in which each
part of a tent is generally enclosed, when on
the elephant, camel, bullock, or cart, by which
it is conveyed; to handle a <em>phourah</em>, or mattock,
to level the interior; and, in short, to compleat
the whole preparation, within and without.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many <em>kalashies</em> are extremely expert in all
the foregoing duties, and are, besides, excellent
domestics; not hesitating to perform a variety
of services about a house, such as swinging the
<em>punkah</em>, (or great fan,) suspended in most
dining halls, rattaning the bottoms of chairs,
helping to arrange, and to clear, furniture, and
doing, besides, the duties of <em>hirkarahs</em>, or <em>peons</em>.
This general assemblage of useful talents, no
doubt, renders the <em>kalashy</em> a most useful servant;
hence, more are retained at this time,
than were formerly employed.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a public servant, whether attached to the
train of artillery, or to a quarter-master’s establishment,
his merits are equally conspicuous:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>in the former he is enrolled in some company,
in which rank may be obtained by a due continuance
of good conduct. Though in a private
capacity he rarely receives more than five rupees,
he may, in the latter instance, consider his average
pay at six rupees; which, with the chance
of promotion to the several ranks of <em>cossob</em>, <em>tindal</em>,
and <em>serang</em>, with consequent encrease of wages
at each gradation, is considered a very respectable
situation. His duty in the above instance,
is, however, by no means trifling: during the
whole day he is employed, generally in the
arsenal, or the store room, or the artillery shed;
or, eventually, in drawing timbers, cannon, &amp;c.
on transport carriages; mounting, or dismounting
great guns, cleaning arms, working in the
laboratory, piling, or serving out, shot; with a
million of et ceteras in the various branches of
that department. Whether attached to the train,
or serving with a regiment of infantry, or cavalry,
the <em>kalashy</em>, (or, as he is often termed while in
the public service, the <em>lascar</em>) must be adroit
in whatever relates to camp-equipage, making
up ammunition of all kinds, sorting stores, packing,
loading, serving, and drawing field-pieces,
limbering, yoking the cattle, marking out lines
for a camp; and, in short, whatever relates
either to the ordnance, or to the quarter-master’s
duties. All appertaining to these branches, are
cloathed in woollens of English manufacture:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>those in the artillery wearing blue jackets with
red trimmings, and such as appertain to regiments
of cavalry, or of infantry, being served
with such colors as may assimilate with the dress
of the corps respectively: unless when a quantity
of any particular color is on hand in the
Company’s stores; in which case, it is disposed
of by varying the dress of regimental lascars, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>pro
tempore</em></span>, as far as it will go.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole of the <em>kalashies</em> wear blue turbans,
of rather a flat form, having on their edges a red
tape, about three fourths of an inch in breadth;
which greatly relieves the sombre appearance of
their jackets.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>kalashies</em> on board <em>budjrows</em>, which are
generally of the pinnace, or keeled, kind, may be
placed, nearly on a footing with those retained
by individuals; allowing for a certain imitation
of the public servant, and a smattering in what
relates to the management of sails. This class is
by no means numerous, being confined entirely
to the aquatic equipages of great men: one of
this description is by no means flattered when
directed to handle an oar on board the <em>budjrow</em>,
though he prides himself in rowing a jolly-boat
furnished with oars on the European plan.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Manjy</em>, <em>Goleeah</em>, and <em>Dandy</em>, are the
steers-man, bow-man, and common rower in a
boat, respectively. Where a gentleman keeps
a boat, he must always retain the two first, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>if in constant employ, the last also; or he may
generally, by previous notice, obtain a crew of
<em>teeka-dandies</em>, that is, job-watermen, at any of
the <em>ghauts</em>, or wharfs, along the river. The
<em>manjy</em> is usually paid from five to seven rupees
per mensem; the <em>goleeah</em> from four to five; and
the <em>dandy</em> from two and a half to three and a
half, or even four; all according to the kind of
boat, and the dignity of the employer. There
is no established dress for either of the above
classes; though the <em>manjy</em> will, in general, be
found to adopt a mixed costume, between the
<em>kalashy</em> and the <em>mosaulchy</em>. His business is to
steer, and to give directions regarding the several
operations incident to the very numerous
metamorphoses of circumstances in rivers perpetually
changing their direction: thus, it is by
no means uncommon to see a <em>budjrow</em> hoist,
and lower, her sails, take to her oars, or to the
track-rope, some scores of times during the
course of a day’s progress; just as the localities
may render necessary. Whatever authority
may be vested in a <em>manjy</em>, it is rare to see one
able to enforce his orders: each of the crew has
an opinion of his own; and, knowing that his
services cannot be dispensed with, will, in most
cases, adhere to his way of thinking, until peremptorily
compelled by the master’s interference,
to submit to orders; or overcome by
absolute force.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>The <em>Goleeah</em> has particular charge of the bow,
where he either rows the foremost oar, or, when
necessary, keeps the boat from running against
the bank, or upon shoals, by means of a <em>luggy</em>,
or bamboo pole, probably thirty feet, or more, in
length; first casting it out in the proper direction,
and then lapping it round several times with
the end of a strong tail-strap, fastened to a ring
on the forecastle; so as to prevent the pole from
returning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have not witnessed the dexterity of
this class of people, and the rapidity with which
they recover their poles, so as to make repeated
resistances in dangerous situations, can form no
idea of the strength, activity, and judgment, necessary
to qualify a man for this arduous situation.
Often the fate of a boat depends on the
certainty of the <em>goleeh’s</em> throw; especially under
a <em>cutchar</em>, or sand bank, perhaps twenty feet, or
more, in height, under which a strong current
cuts away the foundation, occasioning immense
bodies of the soil to fall in, attended by a noise
competiting with thunder. One of these falling
upon a boat, could not fail to sink her; as experience
has too frequently proved. The very swell
occasioned by the fall of such ponderous and
bulky rubbish, amounting perhaps to fifty or sixty
loads, is sufficient to sink the smaller class of
vessels. Fortunately, the <em>cutchars</em>, in general,
subside, as it were, perpendicularly; without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>casting outwards; otherwise, no vessels could
navigate the Ganges, or the other great rivers, at
certain seasons; especially during the early winter
months, when the <em>cutchars</em> are high, and the
current rather strong.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Dandy</em> certainly leads as hard a life as any
scavenger’s cart-horse; and really I know not
what more picturesque instance can be given of
his consummate drudgery! Imagine the effects,
even upon the most hardy constitution, of exposure
to all weathers; at one moment under a
burning sun, or numbed by a cold northerly blast;
by turns on board, or at the track rope; moving
at a slow pace against a rapid current; and wading,
without the smallest hesitation, through a
million of puddles, often up to the neck, or even
obliged to swim: the footing perhaps rugged, or
along a heavy sand, or a deep mud; and the path
lying through briars, bordering steep precipices!
All this the <em>dandy</em> undergoes for the small wages
before specified; rarely equal to three-pence
daily! It is true, he has some reliance on the
produce of the fields he passes through, appropriating
it, together with fire wood, and, occasionally,
some stray poultry, or a kid, to the participation
of his companions. Nor do this class,
which consists promiscuously of Hindus and
Mussulmans, act very fastidiously as to the means
of obtaining their cloathing: they are, indeed,
perfectly divested of those prejudices entertained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>by our judges, and law officers, respecting the
iniquity of purloining whatever may offer itself
to their acceptance: far otherwise; all is fish
that comes to their net. Knowing such to be
the invariable disposition of <em>dandies</em>, the European
must blame himself, should his valuables
be missing in consequence of an ill-placed confidence,
or of neglect in regard to securing his
property, so far as may be practicable. Hence,
it is advisable never to allow any one of the crew
to enter the cabin of a <em>budjrow</em>, under any pretext,
unless attended by a servant; who must
direct his whole attention to the prevention of
theft. Most boats are baled by means of a skuttle
in the cabin: this affords a very reasonable
plea for entrance; but too much caution cannot
be used, when that operation may be necessary;
which may be from two, to fifty, times within
the twenty-four hours; accordingly as the hirer
may be in luck regarding the soundness of his
vessel’s bottom.</p>

<p class='c008'>As to describing a <em>dandy’s</em> dress, that is scarcely
practicable; but a tolerable outline was given
when treating of the passage from the ship at
Kedgeree to the presidency: the perpetual
changes from hot to cold, and from wet to dry,
(for each <em>dandy</em> reserves a dry clout, to put on
when he returns on board,) must, one would
think, at all events, keep the poor wretches
something like clean, and free from vermin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>Such, however, is not the case; for what with
ring-worms, itch, and <em>a certain</em> loathsome, and
infectious disease, added to an inexhaustible
stock of body-creepers, no mortal can well be
more disgusting than a Bengal <em>dandy</em>. It would
be injustice to class them all under one general
anathema; there being, doubtless, some among
them who are tolerably clean in their persons;
but such most assuredly form a very disproportionate
minority!</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Berriarah</em>, or <em>Gurrearah</em>, is a person
who, according to the general custom of the
country, devotes his life to tending sheep and
goats; and, in most situations beyond the metropolis,
obtains a place among the usual servants
attendant upon the out-door concerns of
a family. This is not owing to the scarcity of
meat, but to its bad quality; there being plenty
of sheep in India, which, however, are rarely
slaughtered for table expenditure, even by the
natives; who very justly consider it to be an
unclean animal, feeding on all kinds of filth.
This occasions them to prefer the meat of a castrated
goat, commonly denominated <em>kussy</em>,
which is certainly not to be despised; though
its taste is somewhat strong, and the meat itself
rather coarse, and dark colored: but it abounds
with fat, and is very juicy. Be it good, or bad,
prejudice has proscribed it from the tables of
persons in respectable stations, or in easy circumstances;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>a joint of <em>bazar</em> mutton, that is,
such as the butchers sell in the market, being
considered no treat, and proving extremely obnoxious
to the generality of delicate persons:
though I have frequently seen them partake of
a joint of <em>kussy</em>, when palmed upon them as
home-fed wether, in such style as led me to believe,
that the imagination was a principal agent
in condemning the unfortunate goat-mutton.
I do not mean to deny, that a certain difference
exists; but, when the former could not be had,
I rarely failed to make an excellent meal off the
latter; while some of my more fastidious friends
have been grievously disappointed of their dinners.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sheep may, in a few instances, be purchased
in tolerable good condition, especially during
the hot season, when they nibble the short stems,
and even the roots of the finer grasses; yet it
must not be expected that any, which may be
procurable in the villages, should cut up well:
they are usually mere skeletons; and if they
have any fat it is of a bad color. This compels
gentlemen to keep small flocks, perhaps
from thirty to sixty, according to the average of
expenditure; which, among officers in the army,
may amount to one sheep in every fifteen, or
twenty days: observing, that the meat is seldom
good, nor the animal comparatively the better
for his keep, until it may have been put up for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>about three or four months. The most approved
mode of fatting sheep, is to have about a dozen
on full feed; allowing as much <em>gram</em> as they can
well eat; say about two pounds daily for each:
another dozen should be upon half feed; having
an allowance of very fine chaff to complete their
diet; or perhaps some cut grass, the same as is
brought in for horses. All these twenty-four
sheep should be confined in an area, enclosed
either by mud walls, or by railings of a suitable
height; taking care to allow them access to
sweet water, and to have a small quantity of
salt in a flat vessel, accessible to them at pleasure.
In this manner they will fatten admirably
in the course of six or seven months; their
flesh becoming fine grained, juicy, and high
flavored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the above number, about as many
more should be kept on a small allowance of
<em>gram</em>; allowing them to graze, in company with
half a dozen milch goats and their kids, under
charge of the <em>berriarah</em>, in some place remote
from any camp or town; so as to insure their
feeding clean. This precaution may seem unnecessary,
but is certainly proper; for all sheep,
especially those of India, are particularly partial
to certain excrements, abounding in a country
where the goddess is worshipped on the plains:
the borders of tanks being particularly the resort
of all descriptions of persons, when pressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to pay their <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>devoirs</em></span> to the deity. The dress of
the <em>berriarah</em> is usually similar to that of the
<em>cooly</em>; with this addition, that, on account of
the oppressive heats at one season; the heavy
falls of rain at another; and the sharp cold during
three months; he has constant recourse to a
substantial blanket, generally black: that being
the ordinary color of the sheep. In the hot
season, the blanket serves to repel the heat;
during the rains, to keep him dry; and in the
winter, to keep him warm. As any cross folds,
or pleats, would infallibly rather retain, than
cast off, the rain, these people have recourse to
a most effectual mode of managing the blanket;
tying it together in a very regular manner, after
puckering the longest side, and placing that part
over their heads. Whatever portion of moisture
may lodge within the short pleats above the tie,
cannot sink downwards, if the ligature be properly
made; while all the pleats below it, being
in a perpendicular direction, serve as channels
to carry the water downwards. In fact, the
blanket becomes a bell-tent, of which the inhabitant
is himself the pole. The wages of the
shepherd are usually about three and a half, or
four rupees monthly; but some gentlemen regulate
them by the number of sheep maintained:
this by no means answers their expectations;
for if the number be great, one or two deficiencies,
imputed to the wolves, are rarely noticed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>and if the flock be small, the only chance
a shepherd has, is to make away with a fat
sheep, now and then. No sheep can be fatted,
taking all things into consideration, under four
rupees, equal to about ten shillings, including
the price given; which of late years has risen to
about a rupee per head, for such as have six
teeth: all below that age are generally rejected,
because their food goes more towards their
growth, than to their flesh; which is seldom of
a good color, but retains a certain light hue,
like very young beef, until the second year be
passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wool of the Bengal sheep is by no means
valuable, as an article of commerce; it being
coarse and lank, more resembling dog’s hair than
a fleece. The natives manufacture a good deal
of it into <em>puttoos</em>; which may be made in any
form, being nothing more than a very heavy
close kind of felt, which, when well made,
stands proof against the severest weather. The
usual shape of these <em>puttoos</em> is nearly conical,
and more resembles a bell-tent, than any thing
now occurring to my memory; the generality
are made with a border, rudely worked, of some
color strongly contrasting with the body of the
cloak: thus, a black <em>puttoo</em> would have a white
pattern, another white <em>puttoo</em> a black pattern.
This manufacture is extremely simple, and performed
by means of a kind of carding machine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>that entangles the wool; which is previously
mixed in a very strong lather of soap.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already stated, that the average price
of a sheep fit for fatting, is about a rupee; but
that price has only existed for about twenty
years. Before that date, the common value of
a <em>coarge</em> (or score) was from six to eight rupees;
and I recollect, about twenty-nine years back,
when marching from Berhampore to Cawnpore,
with a detachment of European recruits, seeing
several <em>coarges</em> bought for their use, by the contractor’s
<em>sircar</em>, at three, and three and a half
rupees! at the latter rate six sheep were purchased
for a rupee; which, in British currency,
would be <em>five-pence each!</em></p>

<p class='c008'>It is true, the sheep were not fat; far from it;
being driven into the camp from the flocks grazing
in the adjacent plains, and, in general, taken
without much selection. They were the only
animal food we could at times get; for the Hindus
would never sell us an ox, knowing it was
intended for slaughter. Notwithstanding the
very low rate at which the sheep were purchased,
many proved dear bargains. Some had
their livers in such a dreadful state as disgusted
every spectator, and caused an insuperable objection
against the meat: fluke-worms crawled
about in hundreds; while, of many, the stomachs,
as well as the intestines, were completely
lined with bots, which stood as close as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>could stow, keeping each other parallel, like
pins on a cushion! Strange to say, some few
of which the entrails were thus preyed upon,
seemed as though they would have thriven,
provided they had been turned into a good
pasture.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Chokey-dar</em>, or watchman, is a very different
sort of being from such as guard the British
metropolis. In India, no man dare undertake
this office, unless he be a professed thief,
or in league with the local chief of all the
thieves of the district. Were any person of a
contrary description to assume the protection of
a house, &amp;c. he would be outwitted, and, in
all probability be implicated; or he would lose
his life in the Quixotic attempt! This may give
but an unfavorable idea of the police; but, on
examination, it will be found by no means so
injurious to the interests of the public, as persons
ignorant of the fact, and of its derivation, might
suppose. Thieving is there put on a par with
other speculations; it becomes a monopoly, the
invasion of which carries with it the most fatal
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>To explain this, I must state, that, in the
vicinity of all great towns, there will be found
some person of apparent respectability, whose
word indeed passes with the same validity as
other mens’ bonds; and who is considered
the chief of the <em>chokey-dars</em>, or watchmen; of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>which he will furnish one, or two, perhaps
three, according to the extent, and situation, of
the premises to be guarded.</p>

<p class='c008'>For each person thus supplied, four rupees
are paid monthly to the individual employed;
the head-man being responsible for whatever
losses may be occasioned by professed robbers.
The <em>chokey-dar</em> attends during the day, often
performing many little offices, in the most willing
and effective manner; at night parading
about with his spear, shield, and sword, and
assuming a most terrific aspect, until all the
family are asleep; when—<span class='fss'>HE GOES TO SLEEP TOO</span>!!!</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus the matter is compromised; the gang
receive a tribute, and the gentleman is insured
from nocturnal depredation: though, by way of
deception, slight feints are now and then made,
in order to keep up the system of terror, and to
uphold the <em>chokey-dar’s</em> vigilance. I am sensible,
that instances may be adduced of houses
being plundered, and of the <em>chokey-dars</em> being
cut to pieces. These, however, do not confute
the well known fact I have above delivered; on
examination it will always appear, that such
robberies were committed either by some gang
from another quarter, or where the premises
were in charge of military guards.</p>

<p class='c008'>So audacious are the thieves in India, that
they have been known to come into a cantonment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>with lighted <em>mosauls</em>, in imitation of a marriage
procession, or of a religious ceremony, and thus to
attack a treasury where a strong guard was posted.
They likewise crawl about in dark nights, so as
to be mistaken for dogs, or other small animals;
thus gradually lulling the vigilance of a sentry,
and making their way good to the interior. On
such occasions their bodies are usually well
oiled, thereby rendering it impossible to retain
a hold; which is, in most cases, prevented by a
small sharp knife, always carried in a girdle by
these insinuating rogues: that girdle consists
only of a stout piece of twine carried round the
waist, supporting a <em>lungooty</em>, or clout, passing
between the legs, and as narrow as an exception
from absolute nudity can possibly admit.</p>

<p class='c008'>When travelling through any part of the Company’s
territories, it is proper to require <em>chokey-dars</em>
from such villages as may be in the vicinity
of the encampment: on failure of this precaution,
robbery will very often take place,
without the most distant chance either of recovering
the lost goods, or of tracing the thieves.
Nor should such <em>chokey-dars</em> be sent away unpaid
for their night’s labor: two annas, equal to
nearly four-pence, should be given to each;
otherwise, intelligence of the <em>deficit</em> will be conveyed
to the next halting place, and no <em>chokey-dar</em>
will be forthcoming; unless, indeed, one of
the collector’s peons accompany, or, that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>order be sent, particularly cautioning all the inhabitants
to provide whatever may be wanting.
The reader must not imagine himself in England,
but transplant his ideas to a country where there
is no public place of accommodation, no relay
of horses, no public conveyance, and perhaps
no other Christian within scores of miles! His
fancy may have abundance of scope, in picturing
to him the variety of preparations necessary
to be made before a party, much more a single
gentleman, breaks ground, for the purpose of
sporting, or of repairing to some distant station.
He will then see how very necessary it is to
adopt the local customs, as well as every means
that prudence can devise; observing particularly,
that when a gratuity is to be bestowed upon any
villager, &amp;c. for provisions, or services, he
should never fail to see the full sum paid into
the poor fellow’s hand: otherwise, the servants
will at least diminish, if not altogether withhold,
the donation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consequence of the great number of servants
that sleep within the houses, and the circumstance
of each dwelling having a separate
gateway, where a <em>durwan</em>, (or porter,) constantly
attends; as well as owing to the great number
of <em>chokies</em> or patrole stations, every where to be
seen; few <em>chokey-dars</em> are employed in the town
of Calcutta, unless by merchants who have
warehouses full of valuable commodities; or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span><em>shroffs</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> bankers) residing in that part of the
town inhabited principally by natives: at the
<em>baugeechahs</em>, or garden-houses, which generally
stand, like our farm-houses, at some distance
from other dwellings, <em>chokey-dars</em> are found to
be indispensably necessary. Within the Company’s
provinces no head <em>chokey-dars</em> are to be
seen: there the watchman may perhaps be exempt
from the imputation of belonging to the
local gang: though circumstances do sometimes
authorize the suspicion, that he aids the perpetrators
of the robbery. Generally speaking, however,
there appears no ostensible person who
comes forward to guarantee the safety of goods
under charge of a <em>chokey-dar</em>: when this most
desirable assurance is wanting, the greatest vigilance
is sometimes inadequate to the prevention
of theft. It is not a very easy matter to
defeat the machinations of a most expert banditti,
in a country where it is necessary to throw
open every door, and window, during the night,
lest suffocation should ensue!</p>

<p class='c008'>I have said that a <em>Durwan</em>, or porter, is stationed
at the gate, on entrance into that area,
(called the <em>compound</em>,) within which most
houses in Calcutta are situated. This servant
usually receives from four to five rupees monthly,
and dresses little better than a <em>cooly</em>; though, in
some instances, he may be seen more respectably
cloathed. So soon as a palanquin enters the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>gate, the <em>durwan</em> vociferates lustily; informing,
that a visitor approaches; when immediately
some other servant, such as a <em>peon</em> or <em>hirkarah</em>,
runs to enquire the name, &amp;c. which is immediately
announced to the master or mistress.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>durwan</em> is always allowed a small lodge
near the portal, where he is in constant attendance
day and night. When the family have retired
to rest, he shuts and secures the gates:
formerly, it was an invariable rule to close them
during meals, and to retain them in that state,
until notice was sent by the head servant that
all the plate, &amp;c. were safe. This certainly
was not a bad custom; and, no doubt, operated
as a check upon many, who, but for such a restriction,
would purloin some valuable article
of a portable description: I regret to think it
should have been not only relaxed, but nearly
abandoned: probably owing to mistaken delicacy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Cahar</em>, or palanquin-bearer, is a servant
of peculiar utility, in a country where, for four
months, the intense heat precludes Europeans
from taking much exercise; and where, during
a similar term, the constant state of puddle, in
every place not artificially raised, and drained, at
a great expense, utterly precludes them from
walking. Indeed, even in the cold months, it
is not always that the palanquin can be dispensed
with: at all events; the <em>chattah</em>, or large umbrella,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>must accompany. Many gentlemen who
arrive during the winter season, find the sun little
more than comfortable; they therefore, very
foolishly, dispense with the <em>chattah</em>, and allow
themselves to be heated extremely. So many
instances have happened of persons being carried
off suddenly, in consequence of such exposure,
that I cannot too earnestly exhort all visiting
India, to be very cautious of placing reliance on
strength of constitution: the strongest are in
most danger; on them fever seizes firmly, giving
but little time for the adjustment of affairs, and
even less scope for the exercise of medical skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>The number of, what is called, a set of bearers,
varies according to the situation, the occupation,
and the weight of the employer. In
Calcutta, where there is much visiting, at least
seven must be kept, of whom one stays at home
to cook victuals for the rest; and as another of
them will probably be the <em>sirdar</em>, or head-bearer,
who attends personally when his master is dressing,
and generally has some charge of linen, &amp;c.
he will not, except on emergency, officiate under
the bamboo. Thus, in fact, only five will be
left to carry the palanquin and the umbrella;
the man bearing the latter at times relieving one
of the four that carry the vehicle; and they, in
exchange, assuming his part of the labor, alternately.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are, however, various tribes of bearers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>generally provincial, all of which are to be found
at Calcutta; those chiefly employed in that capital
are called <em>Ooreeahs</em>, <i>i.e.</i> natives of the province
of Orissa; a tract of country lying between
the Roopnarain and the northern <em>sircars</em>: this
occasions them to be generally designated ‘Balasore-bearers:’
Balasore being the principal town.</p>

<p class='c008'>Language is scarcely adequate to describe the
influence this set of menials had obtained,
throughout those parts to which they extend
their services; which is rarely more than a few
miles around Calcutta. They are, in fact, a
commonwealth, governed by one or more of
their gang, and subject to the regulations, from
time to time, established by councils convened,
in the most imperious manner, by the old
<em>sirdars</em>; every trespass against which is attended
with, not only immediate punishment, by means
of ejection from among their society in the town,
but absolutely by a species of out-lawry, even
in their own country!</p>

<p class='c008'>To such a pitch had these gentry carried their
audacity, that, more than once, they withdrew
from Calcutta, leaving its inhabitants in the
most awkward predicament, until they thought
fit to return, or that their insolent demands were
complied with. If any offence be given to one
or more, especially to a whole set, the matter is
instantly submitted to their superiors; who
have, on many occasions, issued their mandate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>interdicting all <em>Ooreeahs</em> from engaging in the offender’s
service. Where real injury is done,
they never fail to carry the matter either before
the commissioners of the police, or into the
supreme court: the costs being defrayed by a
general assessment. The prudence with which
they proceed, in this mode of prosecution, is by
no means unworthy of notice; if imitated by
some of our own litigious spirits, it could not
fail to save infinite vexation, trouble, and expence.
They put the case, very fairly, before a
fictitious tribunal, consisting of <em>sircars</em>, writers,
&amp;c. who, having been employed by gentlemen
of the law, have picked up a smattering of that
profession, and are perfectly acquainted with all
the forms attendant upon most civil causes.
These ‘base epitomes of legal greatness’ possess
wonderful shrewdness; and, by means of
two fictitious advocates of a corresponding description,
who, with an acuteness scarcely to be
equalled, argue their respective sides of the
question, <i>i.e.</i> plaintiff and defendant, are enabled
to decide on the case with strict propriety.
The fact is, that this mock court, being instituted
for the purpose of preventing any native,
who chooses to have his cause pleaded before it,
from being entangled in that glorious net of perplexity,
the supreme court, every endeavor is
made to sift the several turns and arguments, that
may be resorted to by the defendant. Consequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>it is ever the study of the accusing
party to strengthen his opponent’s side, with
every subtlety that can be devised. The sages
give their opinions the same as in our courts;
but are very cautious never to decide in favor of
a plaintiff, unless the case appears fully established.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a well-known fact, that, with the exception
of a few haughty, opinionated individuals,
who, relying on their own judgment, and thinking
such a resort would degrade them, or perhaps
discover that chicanery on which they rely
for success, omit the above very sagacious precaution,
scarcely an instance is to be found
where a native, residing in Calcutta, has failed
to gain his cause against an European. To such
a tribunal, as above described, the <em>Ooreeahs</em> almost
invariably resort; when, if its decision is
in their favor, the <em>real</em> court soon becomes
arbiter on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is perhaps fortunate for the inhabitants (I
mean the European families) of Calcutta, that,
within the last twenty years, great numbers of
<em>Patna</em>, <em>Dacca</em>, and other <em>cahars</em>, or bearers, have
resorted to the presidency, to participate in
those services formerly monopolized by the
<em>Ooreeahs</em>. The latter, after some struggle, by
endeavoring to intimidate their rivals, and by
debarring the <em>teeka</em>, or job-bearers, who were
formerly, to a man, of the Balasore tribe, from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>serving, even for the day, those who retained
Patna, or other <em>cahars</em>, were, in the end, obliged
to lower their tone, and rather to conciliate,
than to arrogate, upon all occasions. Not that
they are by any means reconciled to the new
system; but they find their mandates of less
force, their influence nearly extinguished, and
their numbers considerably decreased: at least,
they bear no proportion to the <em>cahars</em> from the
country; who now ply for <em>teeka</em>, <i>i.e.</i> job-work,
in every quarter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still it must not be denied, that the <em><a id='corr304.12'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Ooreahs'>Ooreeahs</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_304.12'><ins class='correction' title='Ooreahs'>Ooreeahs</ins></a></span></em> are,
in some respects, excellent servants: they are
very careful of furniture; and being able-bodied
men in general, are capable, even with less
numbers, of proceeding great distances: they
are, besides, far more cleanly in their persons,
and neater in their dress; which, however, consists
merely of a <em>doty</em>, wrapped round the middle,
and tucked in, together with a wrapper, to
be thrown over them in very inclement weather,
but usually folded up, and carried over the
shoulder. When their heights are unequal, they
use a small quilted pad, of linen, stuffed with
rags, or cotton, which is suspended from the palanquin
pole, or bamboo, and being placed between
it and the shoulder of the shortest bearer
of the two, (they carrying in pairs, two bearers
before, and two behind,) serves to bring about an
even bearing on each.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>The Balasore bearers, <i>i.e.</i> the <em>Ooreeahs</em>, all
preserve but one lock on the top of their heads,
the same as the <em>sircars</em>, and other Hindus in general;
they wear no turban, but paint their faces,
arms, throats, and breasts, with sandal-wood
and vermilion. Some wear a few small beads,
chiefly of turned wood, about their necks; and,
occasionally, a stout silver ornament, of the ring
kind, called a <em>bangle</em>, or <em>kurrah</em>, on either wrist,
or a pair of tigers’ claws set in silver, back to
back, suspended by a number of black threads
from their necks. This is considered a potent
charm against <em>J’haddoo</em>, or witchcraft: and a
preventative of various dangerous diseases. It is
peculiar, that the <em>Ooreeah</em> bearers never wear
shoes, and that they prefer cloaths of an almond
color. The number of <em>Ooreeahs</em> in a single set,
is generally, as before stated, seven: the head-bearer
or <em>sirdar</em>, receiving five, or even six,
rupees monthly; sometimes a mate receives,
or is said to receive, five, and the residue
about four. Formerly the rates were generally
one rupee less than the above for each rank: but
‘the hay was made while the sun shone,’ and
these gentry did not fail, <em>while in power</em>, to raise
their respective wages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where there is a lady in the family, three
more bearers must be added; or perhaps five:
and a good comfortable building must, at all
events, be set apart for these domineering servants:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>without that is done, they will not stay.
Nor will they handle a <em>chillumchee</em>, (or wash-hand
bason,) after it has been used: though
they will officiate in pouring the water, serving
the napkin, laying the shaving apparatus, and a
variety of matters formerly supposed to be repugnant
to their tenets; but which objections
are not so much insisted upon since the country
<em>cahars</em> have resorted, in such numbers, to Calcutta,
and aided to overthrow that immense
edifice of insolence, imposition, and pride, so
conspicuously rearing its head; whereof, fortunately,
the foundation was thus destroyed.
I perfectly recollect the time, and, indeed, the
matter is not yet obsolete, when the <em>council</em>, as
the <em>sirdar</em> vainly termed their meeting, used to
send their summons to any <em>Ooreeah</em> in an European’s
service; and, in case of refusal, or neglect,
mulcted the party according to their pleasure.
Thus, no individual, however attached to his
master, or tired of the noxious and tyrannic
mandates of the <em>sirdars</em> dared to disobey; the
smallest relaxation in points of forbearance, or in
the least tending to augment the duties of the
whole class, whether individually or collectively,
was certainly followed by the most severe inhibitions,
and by fulminations, perfectly terrific
to those brought up in ignorance, and under the
complete domination of a persecuting priesthood.
A few instances occurred wherein the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>masters almost forcibly debarred their servants
from obedience to the adjudications of this overbearing
usurpation; but it was in vain: the
government, perhaps prudently, discouraged
every attempt to change the system; while the
Supreme Court, then newly robed, and panting
for the exercise of power, whereby to shew their
extensive authority, and their sedulous attention
to the rights of ‘an oppressed people’, favored
every complaint wherein a native was to
be redressed: this was done with the view to
annihilate those multifarious extortions, and severities,
not to say cruelties, under which it was
supposed they were groaning. The farce had
its day, like all other good farces; but, in the
end, Blacky found out that law was very expensive,
and that it had so many ins and outs,
with which they were then unacquainted, that
the disease fortunately carried its own remedy:
the fact, as it now stands, being simply this;
that all are ready enough to complain to a <em>justice</em>,
but are very shy of bringing the subject before a
<em>judge!</em></p>

<p class='c008'>Where bearers are not constantly wanted, (a
very uncommon case, by the by,) the best mode
is to hire <em>teeka-bearers</em>, when occasion may demand:
for ordinary excursions, five are usually
employed; each receiving four annas, or the
quarter of a rupee, daily. This has its advantages,
and its disadvantages; for it is not always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>these job-men are to be had; nor will they come
at the hour appointed; then, again, they must
go (the Lord knows where) to their meals; and
they are by no means so careful of the palanquin,
&amp;c. as regular servants; nor will they attend
to a variety of in-door matters, which may
be peremptorily requisite. It must further be
obvious, that, if the occasions for employing
them be numerous, they will prove very expensive:
consequently, can only suit those whose
incomes are confined, and whose ordinary avocations
do not lead them further than may be
walked, without danger, or great inconvenience,
under the shade of a <em>chattah</em>, or umbrella. It is
evident, that one <em>sirdar</em> at five, one mate at four
and a half, and five bearers at four each, amount
only to twenty-nine rupees and a half per mensem;
whereas five <em>teekas</em>, if employed every
day at a rupee and a quarter daily, will amount
to thirty-seven rupees and a half. This would
be like riding in a Hackney-coach all day, when
an excellent equipage might be kept for less
money.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Patna, Dacca, and other up-country bearers,
in general receive less wages than the <em>Ooreeahs</em>;
but require to be more numerous in a set;
few consisting of less than eight, including the <em>sirdar</em>,
who generally remains at home. His usual
wages are from four and a half to five rupees,
and the rest receive from three up to four rupees
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>monthly; according to circumstances. When
in their own country, they serve for less wages
than when employed elsewhere. Those at
Dacca, where provisions are very cheap, seldom
have more than two, of two rupees and a half;
and it is wonderful how reluctant they are to
quit that part of the country, even under a very
considerable advance of pay; therefore, when a
corps marches from the Dacca district, every
endeavor is made to procure bearers who are
going to the several districts lying in, or near,
the route. This is sometimes attended with
considerable convenience; since it obviates the
necessity of exchanging servants while on the
march; it being extremely common for bearers
to proceed only to an appointed town, there to
leave their employer, who must use his endeavors
to obtain others in their stead. Thus,
in marching from the frontier to Lucknow, or
Cawnpore, it is necessary to obtain a new set of
bearers at either of those places, to proceed to
Benares; at Benares they will engage probably
to go no further than Patna, if proceeding by the
river route; or, if by the new road, only to
Hazary-Bang, or perhaps to Rogonautpore, or
to Bissunpore; where a final exchange must be
made, for a set that will proceed to Calcutta,
Midnapore, &amp;c. Yet it cannot be said that
this occasions any very serious difficulty; the
occurrence being so common, and the prices
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>so well settled by the ordinary practice, that,
unless a gentleman has the character of using
his servants ill, there seldom appears any deficiency
of candidates for employment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bearers, of all descriptions, are extremely
apt to carry too much luggage for themselves,
stowing it, to an unmerciful amount, on the
back of some poor camel, or on some cart, which
their master thinks is very lightly laden. The
mischief is not suspected, until he notices, day
after day, the late arrival of his baggage, or receives
a report that his cattle have sore backs,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; which must, of course, prove highly
pleasing in situations where no substitutes for
the disabled beasts can be found!</p>

<p class='c008'>Let me recommend my mode of correcting this
evil; under which I was so often, and so
grievously, a sufferer, that, at length, a radical
cure became indispensable. I made a point of
lagging behind sometimes, or perhaps of riding
back, and of stopping my camels, &amp;c., to see
what, besides my own property, might be on
their backs. It is inconceivable what bundles of
cloaths, pots, and pans, were burthened: nay,
even perroquets sometimes formed a part of the
group. In the first instance, I gave fair warning,
that whatever was found thus clandestinely
laden, should be destroyed: after that, I spared
nothing; but caused all the brass vessels to be
beat up with a tent-mallet, and the rest of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>luggage to be burnt. The consequence was
such as might be expected; my baggage was
always up in excellent time, and my cattle were
no more chafed, and galled, by excessive burthens.</p>

<p class='c008'>I anticipate the observation, that, ‘the drivers
were to blame.’ True, but few of them have the
resolution to withstand solicitation, or, perhaps,
a small douceur, in some shape or other; and as
to discharging them, it is not always practicable,
the greatest fear being that they should discharge
themselves. Elephants and camels must not be
put into the hands of novices: neither will they
always submit to be ruled by strangers.</p>

<p class='c008'>As I have just said, the bearers are almost
always principally concerned in these instances;
the reason for which is, that every other servant
has usually some family, or goes share in
some <em>tattoo</em>, (poney,) which conveys his luggage:
not that they would be a whit more scrupulous,
were it not for the fear of discovery; to
which they would be peculiarly liable. On the
other hand, the Bearer, being perhaps merely a
temporary servant; and, if I may so term it, an
alien in the camp, has no such means of disposing
of his luggage, as falls to the lot of the
regular servants: besides, all this tribe are
either most penurious, or most dissipated. They
either hoard every <em>cowrie</em>; or run in debt, and
then, to avoid payment—run away.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>The immediate business of a head-bearer is
to prepare for his master’s dressing; seeing that
the linen is all properly in order, boots and
shoes cleaned, coat, &amp;c. brushed, side-arms,
&amp;c. bright; also that the palanquin is clean,
and free from defect; that the water used for
drinking be purified; that the kettle is put on in
due time: in general, the inferior bearers clean
the furniture, and carry the <em>chowry</em>, (or whisk,)
and swing a kind of <em>punkah</em>, (or fan,) made
either from a large palm leaf, or with split
bamboo, and printed cotton; of which pieces
are to be had stamped expressly for that purpose;
they are swung backwards and forwards to cool
a room: the butt of the <em>punkah-stick</em> resting on
the ground. A <em>punkah</em> is, by some, used instead
of a <em>chattah</em>, (or umbrella); but it is very
inferior as a defence against either sun, wind,
or rain. The natives in some parts, especially
to the northward, use these <em>punkahs</em> very generally;
but, of late, they seem to have rather
changed in favor of the <em>chattah</em>, great numbers
of which are now conveyed, as an article of merchandize,
from the lower provinces to Benares,
Lucknow, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dress of the <em>cahar</em>, by which I mean the
up-country bearers, usually consists of a colored
turban, blue being, if anything, the prevailing
color; the head-bearer generally has a short
<em>coortah</em>, not unlike that of the <em>mosaulchy</em>, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>as well as all the inferiors, wears a <em>doty</em>, in the
usual manner: though some few wear a kind of
petticoat-trowser, not unlike the Highland kelt.
<em>Cummer-bunds</em> are also in general use; though,
with few exceptions, of a very coarse quality.
Many gentlemen present their <em>bearers</em>, <em>hirkarahs</em>,
<em>peons</em>, <em>syces</em>, <em>khedmutgars</em>, and <em>mosaulchies</em>, annually,
with a set of <em>turbans</em> and <em>cummer-bunds</em>, all
of the same color; so that the whole appear, to
a certain extent, in livery. In this indulgence
many of the natives take great pride: on the
whole, indeed, they are as vain as our beau-footmen;
and, like them, can assume wondrous
airs, when they have to deal with the servant of
a person inferior in rank to their own master.</p>

<p class='c008'>While speaking of bearers, I shall describe
the various kinds of palanquins in use; observing,
that the greatest improvements, which perhaps
ever took place in any vehicle, have been
brought forward in the construction of this <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sine
quâ non</em></span> of Indian luxury. In order to preserve
due order, I shall commence with a description
of the <em>naulkeen</em>, or <em>naulkee</em>, it being the first
in rank among the contrivances of this description.</p>

<p class='c008'>This immense carriage is only used by crowned
heads, and may be compared to a portable throne,
on which the prince sits with his feet crossed,
and tucked up under his hams, (the usual sitting
position of Asiatics,) having at his back an immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>pillow, and under him a suitable bedding,
both sumptuously ornamented; besides these,
many smaller pillows lie scattered about, to be
applied as may be found agreeable. The frame
of the <em>naulkeen</em> may be about five feet long by
four broad, well secured at the corners, and
taped at the bottom in a very close manner, both
lengthwise and breadthwise, so as to leave no
interstices. The sides are raised with richly
carved wood-work, generally gilded in a very
shewy style. The <em>naulkeen</em> is carried, like a
litter, by eight men, who support two poles,
one running under each side-bar, and projecting
before and behind; two bearers being at each
extremity, the same as in a palanquin. This
vehicle, though it appears extremely ponderous,
is said, by the bearers, to be far lighter than one
of those <em>Mahannah-palanquins</em> I am about to
describe: no doubt but eight men must feel less
pressure, individually, from such a weight, supposing
it to be equal to that of the <em>mahannah</em>,
which is, to say the truth, a very heavy, though
a very comfortable, machine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>dooly</em>, or covered litter, was certainly
the parent of all the <em>palanquin</em> kind; it is yet in
very common use among the less opulent classes,
and especially employed for the conveyance of
women; in our armies this little vehicle affords
excellent means, of transporting sick and wounded
men, either to the hospitals, or on a march.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>Its usual construction is extremely simple; consisting
of a small <em>carpoy</em>, or bedstead, perhaps
five feet by two and a half; having four stump
feet, about nine or ten inches from the ground,
into which the sides, and end pieces, are tenoned.
A very slight frame of bamboo work, equal in
size to the frame of the litter, is placed over it
horizontally; serving as a roof for the support of
a double cover, (generally of red <em>karwah</em>, or of
blue, or white calico,) which lies over the roof,
and falls all around; so as to enclose the whole
space between the roof and the bedstead. There
is seldom any bedding but what is provided by
the party carried in the <em>dooly</em>; unless it be one
appertaining to some family, thereby it is frequently
used: in such case, the interior is made
very comfortable, and the cover ornamented
with borders, fringes, &amp;c. This last kind,
being almost exclusively appropriated to the
<em>zenanah</em>, is on a very small scale; rarely exceeding
three feet, by little more than two: of
such, thousands are to be hired at Calcutta, and
most of the provincial towns. They carry very
easy; often, indeed, having only two bearers
under the bamboo, with one carrying a <em>bangy</em>,
or a bundle, who relieves the others occasionally;
but, for the most part, four bearers are
employed. The closeness of the interior, added
to the very trifling elevation, (whereby the dust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>cannot fail to be offensive,) and the very insufficient
guard against rain, combine to render
this vehicle by no means pre-eminent for comfort;
especially to delicate females.</p>

<p class='c008'>It should seem that, in the course of time, an
improvement was made in the construction of
litters, by giving the bamboo, or pole, a considerable
arch in that part which went over the
interior. Thus the frame was raised considerably;
while the rider was enabled to sit upright,
rather more conveniently than when the bamboo
was straight: this, however, could only be done
towards the centre; the legs being crossed
under the hams, according to the usual sitting
position of the natives. To them, such a posture,
being confirmed by long habit, in use
from their infancy, is a relaxation; whereas, to
a person not so accustomed, nothing can be
more irksome and fatiguing. Gradually, the sides
of the vehicle were ornamented, and changed
from the simple parallelogram to an oblongated
hexagon; which is now very common: the bamboo
was also yet more arched, and its anterior
projection carried out in an upward curve to the
length of full twelve feet or more: it was also
covered with broad-cloth throughout; that part
above the seat being ornamented with silk fringes,
and the fore-end furnished with a brass ornament;
either a tiger’s, or an alligator’s head, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>perhaps some imaginary non-descript, placed at
the end of a brass ferule, enclosing the bamboo
for half a yard at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>Still there was abundant room for amelioration;
but the natives could brook no encroachment
on the publicity thus given to their persons,
while seated in a vehicle, which, owing to
the weight being nearly on a level with the
bearers’ shoulders, (a great portion, namely, the
head and shoulders, being far above it) added to
the awkward arch above, which operated as a
lever, was peculiarly unsteady; ever threatening
to upset with the least inattention to equipoise.
The danger of adding to the superincumbent
weight, of which the mischief was sensibly
felt, caused a slight reduction of the lever, by
lengthening the suspending laths a few inches, so
as to lower the centre of gravity. But, by way
of recompence, perhaps, for the supposed degradation,
a rich covering of broad-cloth was
thrown over the arch; having in it several bamboo-laths
running at right angles with the bamboo;
and forming a canopy, corresponding in
form with the curve, about four and a half feet
in width; of which the corners were tied down
to those of the palanquin frame, and the edges
were trimmed with an open quadrated, or reticulated
fringe, full six inches in depth.</p>

<p class='c008'>As it would be a sin to spoil so costly an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>awning, it was taken off in bad weather, and
put into a bag made of wax-cloth, to be carried
on one of the bearers’ shoulders; in the mean
while, a large sheet, of the same material, was
thrown over the bamboo, to keep the inhabitant
from being washed away. It is not above twenty-five
years back, that this kind of palanquin was
in use among the European residents of India,
and especially among the military.</p>

<p class='c008'>Probably in consequence of a painted canvas
awning being used, curving down gradually at
the sides, not unlike a <em>testudo</em>, this machine
was called a ‘<em>fly-palanquin</em>.’ It was, however,
made full six feet in length, and of a comfortable
breadth, being also furnished with a good
pillow or two, and a neat bedding, stuffed with
that kind of cotton known by the name of <em>seemul</em>.
The bamboo frame, on which the canvas
was stretched, and of which a ruffle about six
inches in depth remained pendant, was lined
with colored silk, chintz, &amp;c. giving the interior
rather a finished appearance. I have no
doubt but the form of this kind of palanquin, as
in use among the natives, gave rise to the use
of <em>punkahs</em>, in preference to <em>chattahs</em>; it must
be obvious that the former, being flat, and furnished
with a flounce full half a yard in depth,
was more conformable to the lateral apertures
than an umbrella could be; while, at the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>moment, it was far more portable in passing
through those narrow streets and gullies, characterizing
every great city in India.</p>

<p class='c008'>Time ‘astonished the natives,’ as well as the
Europeans, by bringing forth the <em>Mahannah-palanquin</em>.
This vehicle, now so common, has
entirely banished the <em>fly-palanquin</em>, of which it
would probably be difficult to find one in use
with any European throughout the country: so
general, indeed, has been the adoption of the
former, that many of the natives, in every part,
now either ride in <em>mahannahs</em>, or have their <em>doolies</em>
constructed in imitation of them. The <em>mahannah</em>
resembles an immense chest, standing on
four feet, raising it nearly a foot from the ground.
About two-fifths of each side is open, serving
for a door; the residue being usually closed
up, either with very thin pannels, or with
canvas, leather, &amp;c. The doors are sometimes
made to close, by means of two Venetian frames,
that, when brought from their recesses, meet in
the centre, but at other times run back, on
small metal wheels, in grooves behind the pannels
respectively.</p>

<p class='c008'>The roof is made of very thin pannelling
board, laid longitudinally over slight battens a
little cambered; though some are quite flat:
over the boards a stout, but thin, canvas is well
stretched, and beaded down at the edges: this
is usually painted white. The fore, and back,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>parts are in general closed, with the exception
of two small Venetian, or perhaps glass, windows,
near the top; to allow a draught of air.
The exterior is painted according to the fancy of
the proprietor; often very handsomely, and well
varnished. The front and hind poles attach at
about three-fifths up the body of the vehicle;
being rivetted to iron ribs, firmly screwed by
means of diverging claws to the main pieces,
they are further steadied by iron stays, proceeding
from the top and bottom corners, of each
end respectively, to the pole; to which they are
bolted at about eighteen inches from the body.
The poles are always covered with leather.</p>

<p class='c008'>The body of a <em>mahannah</em> is generally about six
feet, or six feet two inches long, and from
twenty-six to thirty inches in width; the height
is sufficient to allow a tall person’s sitting upright,
without a hat. The beddings of most are
covered with chintz of neat patterns; while a
small piece of carpet, tiger’s-skin, morocco-leather,
or some such article, is spread at the
feet, to prevent its being soiled.</p>

<p class='c008'>In most <em>mahannahs</em> there are racks, which
serve to support the back; others are provided
with two small, or one large pillow, also covered
with chintz. Above the doors it is common
to screw in flat brass knobs, whereon to button
either canvas or leather curtains, that will roll up
occasionally, and buckle like the aprons of gigs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>&amp;c.: there are also studs, of the same description,
fixed at the sides of the doors, to fasten
down the edges of the curtains. One principal
use, however, of such studs, is, to affix <em>cheeks</em>
made of <em>kuss-kuss</em>, to be watered when journeying
any distance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>mahannah</em> is unquestionably a very heavy
vehicle, and, being totally devoid of elasticity,
far more oppressive to the bearers than any machine
on a slighter construction. Yet the average
rate of travelling may be computed at from
three and a half, to a quarter wanting of four
miles, within the hour, in going great distances;
such as from Chunar to Calcutta, at the proper
season, when the waters are not out, and the
heat not too oppressive. That estimate includes
all stops for changes of bearers, which, in travelling
<em>dawk</em>, (that is, <em>post</em>,) will take place at
certain stages, from ten to fifteen miles apart.
Thus, a journey of four hundred miles may be
made in about five days, with great ease; the
night being often more favorable than the day
to making progress; especially from March to
the middle of June. During that period, the
roads are every where good, the grass jungles in
most places burnt away, and fewer tigers lurk
near the highways. It is often necessary to lie
by for a few hours during the mid-day; when
the ground is so hot as absolutely to scorch the
bearers’ feet. At such times, the <em>kuss-kuss tatties</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>are peculiarly serviceable; but, in case none
are affixed, the <em>guttah-tope</em>, or palanquin-cover,
must be kept wet; as already observed, in describing
the occupations of the <em>bheesty</em>, or water-carrier.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ladies are usually conveyed about Calcutta,
or any where for short distances, in a kind of
palanquin, called a <em>boҫhah</em>. This has its poles
fixed much in the same manner as in the <em>mahannah</em>,
but its body is of a very different form;
being a compound of our sedan chair with the
body of a chariot. Its deep shape, and its seat,
much resemble the former; but having two
doors, one on each side, with one window in
front, as well as a small one behind, all furnished
with Venetians and glasses, give it, in those
respects, some claim to alliance with the latter.
I should have observed, that most of the gentlemen
residing at Calcutta, ride in <em>boҫhahs</em>;
which afford a better look-out, are more portable,
and can turn about in narrow places, where
a <em>mahannah</em> could not: besides, they are far
lighter. The <em>boҫhah</em> made expressly for a lady,
is fitted up in some style, and always has four
large tassels, commonly of white silk, hanging
at the four upper corners. There are usually
pockets in front, and to the doors; the same as
in chariots, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>About Dacca, Chittagong, Tipperah, and other
mountainous parts, a very light kind of conveyance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>is in use, called a <em>taum-jaung</em>, <i>i.e.</i> ‘a support
to the feet.’ This consists of an arm-chair,
with a low back, at the sides of which two poles
are affixed, even with the seat; from the two
fore legs of the chair, iron stays project forward,
supporting a foot-board, placed diagonally, so as
to meet the natural position of the soles when
the feet are thrown forward, much the same as
the foot-boards of coach-boxes, only on a very
light construction. In some instances, the <em>taum-jaungs</em>
(vulgarly called <em>tom-johns</em>) are carried the
same as the <em>naulkeen</em>; that is, by the four ends of
the poles resting on the shoulders of as many
bearers, all independent of each other. Experience
has, however, proved such to be a very
dangerous practice; for, if one of the bearers
stumbles, the machine must inevitably be overset:
the fall from such a height, especially if
proceeding at a quick pace, is not devoid of
danger. To remedy this, it has latterly become
a custom to suspend two stout batons, by means
of strong doubled cords, between the ends of
the poles, before and behind; making such an
allowance in respect to the length of cord, or
sling, as may allow the poles to come down
about as low as the bearers’ hips. The batons
are slung by their middles, one bearer supporting
the fore, the other the hind, part of each;
all moving between the two side poles, but
nearly in a line one behind the other. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>does not altogether obviate the possibility of falling,
by means of a stumble; but it lessens that
danger considerably, and renders the accident
less severe; the seat being much lowered.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this respect, the <em>boҫhah</em> is also safer than
the <em>mahannah</em>; the former being so much nearer
the ground, and the erect position of the rider
rendering him less liable to injury. When the
hind bearers of a <em>mahannah</em> fall, not only the
legs of the vehicle, but the head of its inhabitant,
may be injured: such accidents are
rarely attended with any other inconvenience
than a job for the carpenter. If the fall takes
place when a bearer is pushing behind, resting
the palm of his hand against the butt end of
the hinder pole, as is very common, there will
be an additional impetus, by no means favorable
to the machine; especially if the foremost
bearers give way. Most of the <em>mahannah</em> palanquins
have a box under the feet, and perhaps
one under the head also, made water tight, and
furnished with a lock. This, when travelling,
is extremely convenient; insuring the presence
of many little articles, both of raiment and
refreshment, which, if trusted to a <em>bangy</em>, might
not arrive in due time.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>bangy</em> is a slip of bamboo, perhaps five
feet in length, which, in the middle, may be
four inches in width; the thickness about an
inch; towards the ends it tapers a little, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>has shoulders left, whereby to secure the nets,
wherein are two baskets, made either of rattans,
or of reeds, very closely worked, and probably
covered with painted canvas, of leather. The
<em>bangy-wollah</em>, that is, the bearer who carries
the <em>bangy</em>, supports the bamboo on his shoulder,
so as to equipoise the baskets suspended at
each end. If not overladen, the <em>bangy</em> will
generally keep pace with the palanquin; the
bearer shifting the bamboo from one, to the
other shoulder, as he proceeds.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many gentleman have <em>r’hunts</em>, or <em>r’huts</em>, for
the conveyance of their native ladies, either on
a march, or to take an airing occasionally: in
such case, a man must be employed to drive,
and to take care of the bullocks. He is designated
the ‘<em>g’horry-waun</em>;’ or carriage servant.
His dress cannot be reduced to any exact standard,
but will generally be found to resemble
that of the <em>khedmutgar</em>; his pay being ordinarily
from four to six rupees monthly. The generality
of persons following this avocation, are
rather elderly, and possess the outward shew of
great decency and respectability; but I believe
they are, with few exceptions, by no means of
a character such as would be supposed from
their venerable and sanctified appearance. I
have seen so much, and the instances are
so common, of the intrigues carried on, or
connived at, by <em>g’horry-wauns</em>, as to satisfy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>me of their being as great hypocrites as are
to be found on earth. The construction of a
<em>r’hut</em> is so very curious as almost to defy description.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>g’horry-waun</em> sits astride that part of the
fore-frame which may be compared with the
pole and traverse of one of our four-wheeled
carriages, under a <em>seiwaun</em>, or <em>semiaun</em>, made of
the same stuff as the covering, supported in
nearly a horizontal position, by two slight
poles fixed into iron ferules at the body of the
frame, and proceeding, at and angle of about 45°
to the foremost edge of the <em>seiwaun</em>. The bullocks
are managed by means of a strong cord,
passed through their <em>septums</em>, or divisions between
their nostrils, and tied over the crowns of
their heads, where the rein, made also of rope,
attaches: this effectually curbs the cattle. Possibly
such a device may appear to partake of
cruelty; but experience has proved, that no
other mode is adequate to keeping this fiery,
restless, and vicious, breed of cattle in tolerable
subordination. The <em>g’horry-waun</em> is provided
with a severe goad: the application of
which, to the hind quarters of the bullocks,
causes them to keep up a good smart trot.
When they are tolerably quiet, the driver’s feet
generally suffice, to keep them to their pace:
but, when all other modes fail, he twists their
tails, and thus urges them to their best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>speed. The reins should serve both to stop,
and to guide; but, as the bullocks are not
always prompt in turning when only so acted
upon, the tail is often resorted to, as a never-failing
rudder!</p>

<p class='c008'>Your true home-bred Englishmen can have
little idea of the rate at which a pair of oxen can
draw one of these <em>r’huts</em>; he cannot readily
imagine, that they can travel from four to six
miles within the hour; and that, too, where the
<em>g’horry-ka-leek</em>, or track of a wheel, is scarcely
to be found. I have seen a pair of <em>Nagore</em>, or
of <em>Guzzerat</em>, bullocks, (I forget which,) standing
full sixteen hands at the withers, (making
allowance for the humps on the shoulders of all
cattle bred in that quarter;) that could with
ease trot with a <em>r’hut</em> at the rate of eight miles
within the hour. But such must not be considered
as common: perhaps five miles may be
the truest average. Nor is it to be understood,
that bullocks keep up an even pace, as horses
do; on the contrary, they either proceed at
their quickest trot, or at a walk; there is little
medium: the fact is, that, not being trained to
a continuance of one set pace, but urged by
starts, at the will of their driver, they want
that habit which would improve their wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>That breed of oxen said to be chiefly raised
in the Guzzerat, and Nagore districts, is very
fine. The animals are of a milky whiteness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>handsomely formed, with fine eyes, and horns
generally not more than a foot in length,
but gracefully turned, partly forward, and
partly upward. The natives invariably either
paint or gild the horns; and sometimes mark
the sides, necks, hams, and shoulders, of their
favorites with <em>mindy</em>; that is, with the plant
generally known among botanists, under the name of
<em>hinna</em>. Of this I shall have occasion
to speak more fully when treating of the ornaments
in use among the ladies of India: at present
briefly remarking, that, whether owing to
the coarse manner in which the <em>mindy</em> is applied,
or to my want of taste, the practice never
pleased me; although the color itself, namely, a
tawny red, forms by no means a bad contrast to
the brilliant whiteness of the animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>A conveyance on two wheels, but in most
other respects perfectly similar to the <em>r’hut</em>, is
extremely common in India; being used by
men, as well as by women. The body of this
kind is usually square; and the roof by no
means so elevated. With few exceptions, these
have red covers, in the sides of which, as also
in those of the <em>r’huts</em>, are small slits, serving for
peep-holes. In this two-wheeled kind, called
generally <em>ghorries</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> carriages,) such are
more necessary than in the others; the former
being almost invariably fitted up with <em>cheeks</em>, or
screens; one of which is ever appended to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>fore-part, between the interior and the driver.
The common <em>g’horry</em>, now under description, is
rarely, if ever, kept by any European; but may
be seen plying for hire in various parts of Calcutta.
Some of these have shafts in which a
<em>tattoo</em> (poney) is fixed, with very slight harness;
barely sufficient to keep the crook-saddle
in its place. This is a recent improvement;
as is also the application of <em>tattoos</em> to <em>r’huts</em>:
I understand they are found to be more manageable,
and far cheaper than bullocks; besides,
their pace is much quicker; and, in case of
failure, they are most easily converted into cash:
an object of great moment to the parsimonious
Hindu!</p>

<p class='c008'>Neither the dress, nor the emoluments, of the
persons driving such carriages, can be estimated
with precision, but, in regard to the latter, we
may safely conjecture that something handsome
is made; knowing them to be employed more
in the conveyance of prostitutes than in any
other kind of fare. The usual hire of a four-wheel
<em>r’hut</em>, drawn by <em>tattoos</em>, is, I believe, about three
rupees per diem; while those with two wheels,
and only one <em>tattoo</em>, at the utmost earn only two
rupees: I never could ascertain any fixed rate;
the <em>g’horry-waun</em> always endeavoring to make
his bargain for the trip to the best advantage.
Judging from the rapid strides made in various
parts of the country, especially at the several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>presidencies, to bring all matters to that kind of
system, without which nothing could be done
in Europe, we may expect, in a few years, to
see regular fares and rates established, as in use
among us, for the prevention of misconduct, and
over-charges, on the parts of Hackney-coachmen
and watermen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>g’horry-waun</em> may further be employed in
a more subordinate capacity; namely, in driving
a common cart, usually called a <em>chuckrah</em>,
and known by the designation of a ‘<em>hackery</em>’
among Europeans. This kind of vehicle may
carry, on an average, about eighteen or twenty
maunds, equal to about thirteen or fourteen
hundred weight: it is drawn by two oxen;
though, in the northern parts of the country, we
often see four attached to those which convey
cotton, or other gruff merchandize, I confine
myself, however, to such as may be retained by
gentlemen, either for the carrying on of works,
or for the transportation of baggage. Such as
are hired by the day, usually cost half, or, at
times, three quarters of a rupee daily, when employed
on the spot; but, if required to proceed
many stages, a whole rupee is demanded.
When the <em>g’horry-waun</em> is the menial of any
officer, &amp;c. his pay, generally, is from four to
five rupees monthly; or sometimes four when
stationary, and five when marching. His dress
is little better than that of a common <em>cooly</em>. Like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>all other servants to whose care the feeding of
cattle is entrusted, this domestic will continue
to extract some perquisite from whatever he
either receives, or has to purchase. What with
<em>dustooree</em>, short weight, over-charges, repairs,
medicines, I have always found the <em>g’horry-waun</em>
fully a match for his British compeers, in the
proportion of emoluments derived from whatever
money, &amp;c. passed through his hands. Fortunately,
the sum total of expences in the maintenance
of a <em>hackery</em>, is very small, when compared
with those attendant on a handsome chariot
and pair, parading daily in the park.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duty of a <em>g’horry-waun</em> is confined to the
charge of his cattle; he seeing them properly
rubbed down, and supplied with provender, which
usually consists of the small chaff from various
kinds of pulse, or of the stems of <em>badjra</em>, <em>jewar</em>,
&amp;c. (various kinds of millet,) or of the <em>bootah</em>,
(or Indian-corn,) which, being purchased in
bundles, he chops, with a common bill, on a
log of wood. When bullocks are allowed <em>gram</em>,
(already mentioned,) the usual portion for each
is about two, or, at the utmost, three seers each;
the seer weighing about two pounds avoirdupoise.
It is indispensably necessary that this servant
should understand how to load his carriage
to advantage, and be able to repair such parts
as may not actually require the aid of artizans.
Thus, he must be competent to sew <em>saleetah</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>or large sacking cloth spread at the bottom of
the <em>hackery</em>, and lapping up, over every part,
so as to prevent articles from being lost; and, in
some degree, keeping them from being injured
by the weather. He must likewise be able to
take off a wheel, and above all things, he must
be a careful, steady driver. This is the more
necessary, owing to the distance between the
wheels in all Hindostanee carriages being very
small; and the load being placed, in most instances,
above the level of their upper fellies;
causing the gravity to be thrown very high in a
<em>hackery</em> laden with bulky articles; and, consequently,
very liable to be overturned. On the
whole, few accidents of this kind happen;
which, considering how much night travelling
prevails in India, is rather surprizing. Possibly
this is owing to the deepness of the ruts on
roads frequented by carriages; whereby the
wheels are presented in their course, so as to
prevent the bullocks from deviating. As to the
distance a <em>hackery</em> can travel in the course of
a day, that must depend entirely on the state of
the road, the strength and condition of the cattle,
the heat of the weather, and the weight to
be drawn: under fair circumstances, from fourteen
to sixteen miles may be effected; but the
latter distance is considered a forced march.
To the weight of the carriage and its load, that
of the driver must be added: he usually sitting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>immediately behind the bullocks. When the
load is unavoidably rather too heavy behind, so
as to cause a tendency to tilting, he sits more
forward, between the cattle, and even occasionally
upon the yoke itself. It is evident the
latter position must be extremely oppressive to
the cattle; but in <em>hackeries</em> laden with cotton,
where the burthen necessarily occupies a great
space, hanging over the rumps of the cattle,
such a position is nearly inevitable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>hackeries</em> used in that branch of trade,
are peculiarly strong, and invariably drawn by
at least three bullocks; though more commonly
by four. Sometimes buffaloes are used; but
their pace is very slow, and they are extremely
addicted to lying down in every puddle: their
immense strength is, nevertheless, a great inducement
to employing them, where very heavy
commodities are to be carried; but it is found
eligible, when buffaloes are yoked, to travel
entirely by night; those animals being by no
means calculated to bear the solar heat, which
oppresses them inconceivably. The native merchants
commonly mix one or two among their teams,
and, not unfrequently, cause full thirty-five
maunds, equal to about twenty-four cwt.,
to be laid on one <em>hackery</em>: but the distance
travelled under such an immense load, can seldom
amount to twelve miles.</p>

<p class='c008'>While on the subject of drivers, which I have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>purposely made the last among the male servants,
it may be as well to offer a few hints
regarding European servants, and English cattle.
It might be said, in brief, that neither the one,
nor the other, is found to answer in India. An
European servant must have nearly as many
natives to attend him as an officer requires; he
must have a house; and a million of indulgences,
such as nearly abrogate his services, must be
shewn towards him. Many have been taken to
India, but the result has generally been, that,
after saving a little money, or making a few
friends, especially by farriery, they have set up
in some business, and with very little warning, or
ceremony, quitted their masters; who, on the
other hand, were usually far from desiring their
continuance. I think my own memory would
furnish sufficient instances to warrant the assertion,
that few, if any, of this class, can be exempted
from the charge of ingratitude.</p>

<p class='c008'>Really, when all things are considered, it must
be owing to excess of vanity, or to some kindred
folly, that any gentleman would retain an European
coachman, or postilion, at full two hundred
rupees monthly, all items included, when an
excellent substitute may be found, among the
many natives who follow those professions, and
to whom a twelfth part of that sum is a little
fortune. As to an European butler, steward,
&amp;c., the same objection exists; with the additional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>inconvenience of having not only an extra
guest at all times, (for his fare will, in every
respect, equal that of his master,) but a spy in
livery, who will hear all the table talk, commercial,
military, or political, and retail it, together
with his own opinions and comments, to the
whole of the native domestics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever a lady has carried out an European
female servant, whether old or young, ugly or
beautiful, it has usually happened that a speedy
separation has taken place: many, indeed, have
deserted from their mistresses while touching at
Madras. Consequently, nothing but vexation
and disappointment are ever to be expected
from the attempt to fix such a person in her
situation after arrival in India. No matter what
bonds, contracts, or agreements, may have
been entered into: these are all got rid of, by
the party’s behaving in such a manner as totally
precludes the possibility of detention. It may
perhaps be urged, that, by reference to a magistrate,
any unwarrantable conduct might be
punished; but, however reasonable such an
expectation might appear in Britain, it would
be found totally inapplicable to India. I much
doubt whether any justice would take cognizance
of such a complaint, unless connected with
some felonious proceeding, which might warrant
him in committing to prison. This may
appear a strange doctrine, and give but an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>indifferent opinion of the police; which, nevertheless,
is superior to our own: it is far easier,
for either European or native, to obtain redress
in Calcutta, than at any of our public offices.
The fact is, that the necessity for upholding the
British character, however much formerly neglected
by some persons in power, is now so well
understood, that, nothing short of absolute compulsion
would actuate a magistrate to commit
an European woman, upon a charge of neglect of
duty, inebriety, insolence, or other such impropriety:
the litigation of pecuniary points would,
of course, be referred to the Supreme Court;
where the expences are at least three times as
heavy as in the British tribunal, and the prosecutor
would, in the end, have little to boast in
regard to gaining his cause; though, possibly,
he might gratify his resentments at a precious
price!</p>

<p class='c008'>Ladies embarking for India should seek for
some female attendant, native of that country,
wishing to return to her home. Many of these
women, whose characters will bear ample scrutiny,
come to England in charge of children, or
with their mistresses, and would be extremely
glad to go back under the joint advantages of
emolument, and protection. An advertisement
will bring forward many applicants: and a constant
search among the advertisements in the
various newspapers, will rarely fail to answer the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>same purpose. As numbers of this class promulgate
their wishes to return to India, an additional
advantage results from this measure; because,
on arrival in the river, an useful interpreter
is at hand; while, perhaps, a trusty and
able servant is obtained; who, being attached,
by many little kindnesses while on board-ship,
would continue to serve, at least until some other
might be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>The female who attends a lady while she is
dressing, &amp;c., is called an <em>Ayah</em>; pretty nearly
corresponding with the ‘lady’s maid’ among us.
The wages of this servant are by no means settled,
but may be taken on average at from eight to twelve
rupees monthly. Some are <em>half-cast</em>
children; that is, of European fathers and native
mothers: brought up in families from their infancy.
To these, good treatment and kindness
should form a valuable compensation for the
smallness of wages; and induce some among
them to remain for numbers of years, faithful
and affectionate; but such are by no means
numerous, when compared with the thousands
who, at a certain age, either quit in search of
places affording either higher pay, or handsome
perquisites; or who, if handsome, engage as
‘house-keepers to single gentlemen!’ The
majority of <em>ayahs</em> are of Portugueze extraction,
being descended from those heroes who, in
times of yore, ‘laid bleeding Asia prostrate at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>their feet;’ but who now compose the most
contemptible race to be found on earth; affording
to the natives ample scope for comparison
between the modern, and the quondam European.
These Portuguese are all ‘good Christians,’
and, in several parts of the country, have
small church-establishments, where they support
missionaries; but in that humble style
which strongly represents that abject state of
Christianity, when the disciples were in a state
of persecution.</p>

<p class='c008'>However much their ancient splendor may
have been tarnished, yet it cannot be denied,
that, in religious matters, the sable Portugueze
of Bengal have out-done the British completely.
They had long ago churches, and have now one
in Calcutta, built at a great expence by an
opulent individual, which may at least competite
with the only English steeple to be seen under
the presidency of Fort-William. This solitary
type of English devotion, was built some twenty
years ago, in an old burying ground, where the
bones of many worthy men, among whom I
reckon my own grand-father, had lain in peace
for scores of years; but which, in making arrangements
for the new edifice, were torn up,
and exposed, without much regard to decency.
It would be difficult to pourtray the horror
expressed in the countenances of many natives,
who were witnesses of the disgusting scene: as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>to their observations, they were indeed pointed;
and conveyed their decided detestation of so sacrilegious
an act. I say sacrilegious, because no
Mussulman would allow even the remains of his
most bitter enemy, to be ejected from their
last asylum!</p>

<p class='c008'>Many Portugueze <em>ayahs</em> affect to be in possession
of genealogies, whereby it should appear
they are lineally descended from most illustrious
characters; most of whom would, no doubt,
be indeed abashed, could they now take a peep
at their ill-fated and degenerate posterity! It is
scarcely to be conceived how much pride is
retained by women of this class: they are fond
of adulation, and love the dear word ‘<span lang="pt" xml:lang="pt"><em>Signora,</em></span>’
even to adoration. To see one of them full
dressed on Christmas Day, is truly diverting;
their costume being, as nearly as circumstances
will admit, that of the days of royalty in France,
with a dash of the antique <span class='sc'>Vera-cruz</span>: to
remind them, I suppose, of that eclipse which
a gradual intermixture with the natives, has
cast upon their once tawny, but now sable,
countenances. One would think, that the
humiliating reflections attendant upon such a
comparison, should prompt them to burn their
pedigrees, and to avoid whatever could induce
to retrospection! But, no; the <em>ayah</em> prides
herself on that remote affinity, to which her
records give the claim; she retains all the offensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>hauteur of her progenitors; which, being
grafted upon the most obnoxious qualities of
the Hindu, or Mussulman, characters, makes a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tout ensemble</em></span> as ridiculous as it is despicable!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Hindostanee <em>ayah</em>, (by which I mean a
woman born either of Mussulman, or of Hindu,
parents,) is rather rare, unless in cases where
young women have lost their <em>casts</em>, and, in a
manner, become aliens to their own sects.
These are said to be far the most valuable servants;
much superior to such as come under
the designation of <em>baundy</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> slave,) and
which have, for the most part, been purchased
in their infancy, from those miserable beings
who, during times of scarcity, have been compelled
to sell their offspring; thereby preserving
the lives of both. The obligation, however,
does not hold good, according to the existing
regulations, under the British government;
slavery being totally repugnant thereto; though
the Mahomedan law authorizes the purchaser
of a child, thus obtained, to retain it, and to
command its services, upon the condition of
proper food and raiment, until a certain age;
when liberation takes place. There is, nevertheless,
in this a wide latitude; it being extremely
difficult for the slave to substantiate his
age, which can only be computed according to
what the purchaser may choose to assert it to
have been when the sale took place: it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>obvious, that he may sink many years in that
particular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although very few of the Hindostanee
women, except such as come under the above
description, serve in the capacity of <em>ayahs</em>
attendant upon ladies, many are employed as
nurses to children after quitting the breast. In
such case, an <em>ayah</em> rarely attends more than one
child; hence, in some families, this class of domestics
would be extremely numerous, were it
not that few children, born of European parents,
are retained beyond their third, or fourth, year in
the country. The generality of those remaining,
even for that term, under the care of <em>ayahs</em>, become
crafty, proud, and unmannerly; which has
occasioned several ladies to engage as few as
possible of those attendants, and to give their
little ones in charge to bearers, or other male
servants; under whose care they are found to be
less vitiated, and, in general, far more healthy.
Unless great attention be paid, <em>ayahs</em> will initiate
their young charges in many practices, and especially
in language, such as must require infinite
assiduity to subdue; and, after all, may not be
completely suppressed. Besides, they are usually
very slovenly, and offensive in their persons.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>Dhye</em> is more generally an attendant upon
native ladies: many of these are perfect in all
the arts of intrigue; and, while they appear to
be tottering to their graves, are often on their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>way to manage an assignation! The dress of
these, in most points, corresponds with that of
the Hindostanee <em>ayah</em>, but their pay is much
less; few receiving more than five rupees, and
the majority serving for four. But, according
to the old saying, ‘what they loose in the dance,
they gain in turning round;’ for what with little
presents from both parties, and a number of
domestic perquisites, especially the remains
of victuals, cast-off wearing apparel, donations
on certain festivals, overcharges in purchases,
<em>dustooree</em> on all articles bought by the lady,
&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c., these Oriental ‘Mother Coles,’
manage to pick up a very good income, and,
not unfrequently, lend money to their mistresses
at the moderate rate of one <em>anna</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> a sixteenth,)
per month, for every rupee advanced.
This is never done without a pledge, generally
of silver or gold ornaments, which the cunning
jades lodge, under various pretexts, with
some friendly goldsmith, by whom they probably
were made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such a rate of interest may appear very high,
but is in general practice where money is lent
for short dates; and then under good security.
It is to be understood, that the money-lending
business, especially that on <em>bunduck</em>, or pledge,
is confined entirely to the Hindus: Mussulmans
are prohibited by their sacred institutes
from receiving, though they are not so strictly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>tied down in respect to paying, interest; indeed,
owing to the less frugal habits of this sect,
and their greater indulgence in ostentatious
display, few of its individuals can be considered
totally exempt from that heavy fine collected
by the Hindu <em>shroffs</em>, and <em>mahajans</em>, from
such inconsiderate persons as have occasion to
seek their aid.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is, nevertheless, remarkable, that the
generality of such money-lenders as reside at
our several cantonments, are extremely liberal
in their advances to officers, who, when much in
arrears, are often extremely pressed for cash
to defray their immediate table expences: and
that, too, even on the most economical plan. I
have been repeatedly kept from starving, by
the accommodation afforded by <em>shroffs</em>; whose
civility and forbearance form a most striking
contrast with the punctual, and greedy, claims
of both the Christian, and the Jewish, Shylocks
of Britain. It must not be denied, that, when
practicable, they will obtain some kind of security
for their loans; which is but reasonable:
but many hundreds of rupees have been furnished
to me, simply on my acknowledgement, on a
scrap of paper, barely specifying the sum and
date, without any form such as could have validated
the claim in case of my demise, or of my
being prosecuted on the occasion. The truth is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>that, where they see no danger, they feel no
reluctance.</p>

<p class='c008'>The generality of <em>dhyes</em> attendant upon native
ladies, hold a regular intercourse with some
one of the above class, by whom all difficulties
resulting from irregular receipts of pay are
removed. This is wonderfully facilitated by
the circumstance of being related to some young
<em>khedmutgar</em> in master’s service. Of this kind
of family compact I have already spoken; therefore
it is not necessary to enter into details at
this moment: my readers will form a just
opinion of the situation in which a gentleman
is placed, when parties are formed, both before
and behind the <em>purdah</em>, (curtain,) to watch his
motions, and to carry on the great work of
deception. In this, I speak feelingly, having,
like hundreds of others, many of whom appeared
studious to perpetuate their misfortune,
been the dupe of such coalitions; from which
it is, indeed, very difficult to escape. The
attachment of many European gentlemen to
their native mistresses, is not to be described!
An infatuation, beyond all comparison, often
prevails, causing every confidence, of whatever
description, to be reposed in the sable queen
of the <em>haram!</em> I do not mean to say that the
above deceptions are universal; for I could
adduce instances, wherein native women have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>conducted themselves invariably in the most
decorous manner, and evinced the utmost fidelity,
in every particular, to their keepers; some
have absolutely sacrificed property to no inconsiderable
amount, and given up every pretension
to <em>cast</em>; that is, to admission among those of
the same sect, or faith, braving the most bitter
taunts, and the reproaches of their friends and
relatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here it may not be out of the way to notice
that strange medley of religion, and of interest,
some may say of love, which is observable in
the conduct of the native women, either residing
under the protection of Europeans, or coming
under the ordinary description of <em>kusbeen</em>, (<i>i.e.</i>
prostitutes). Their rigid adherence to, or, at
least, their superficial observance of, whatever
relates to the purification of their persons, after
contact, is admirable! It is not uncommon,
among those professing immense purity, both
of body, and of soul, to get up several times
during the night, for the purpose of ablution.
However ridiculous such a practice may appear,
yet we cannot refuse to bestow some commendation
on so strict an etiquette: lamenting, at
the same time, that so much perseverance should
be thrown away. Must it not strike every
person, as being highly curious, that a woman
should make no scruple of cohabiting with a
man, whose very touch, indeed, his entrance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>within a certain area, or even treading on that
carpet whereon she were eating, should pollute
the whole of the viands, and occasion their
being thrown to the dogs, or given to some <em>matranny</em>,
or other equally debased character? It
really becomes a very serious question, I believe
hitherto overlooked, under what plea a woman
can allow her child, born under such a connection,
to participate in her meals? But, reason
is one thing, and maternal affection another!
Still, though it may require no great sophistry
for a woman to find an apology for such a decided
inconsistency, it seems unaccountable how
she is suffered to escape that vigilance, with
which the priesthood, and others of her sect,
watch her every act. I can ascribe it only to a
certain deference, which has habitually sprung
up in favor of all relating to Europeans, and
regarding their domestic concerns. This, doubtless,
saves many from those punishments, ordinarily
attendant upon the most trifling dereliction
of religious or civil ordinances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following description of the private lives
and customs of those native women that are
secluded from the public eye, was furnished to
me by a friend, whose extensive researches have
rendered him conspicuous as a Member of the
Asiatic Society. I give it in his own words as
a faithful detail, which cannot fail to prove interesting.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>‘The very confined knowledge which Europeans
have of the domestic manners and customs
of the inhabitants of the Company’s territories,
and of their ally the Nabob Vizier, arising principally
from the total want of familiar intercourse
with the natives, and a consequent ignorance
of the language, is a circumstance which,
by the inquisitive European traveller, would
scarcely be credited. There are few countries
in which a year’s residence would not give a
more intimate knowledge of the language and
manners of the inhabitants, than is generally to
be acquired during a whole life spent in India;
particularly in Bengal and the eastern provinces.
Europeans have little connection with the natives,
of either religion; except what relates to
business of a public, or of a private, nature:
and, though acquaintances, which originate
from such intercourse, may continue after the
causes which gave rise to them have ceased, yet
seldom or never do they extend to domestic
communication. A native will attend rather in
a ceremonious way at a <em>nautch</em><a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c030'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, or other exhibition
given by an European; but no Hindu,
and very few Mussulmans, would eat in an European’s
house; at least at his table. The native
will, in his turn, invite his English friend to a
<em>nautch</em>, to an exhibition of wild beasts, and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>forth; and sometimes an entertainment may be
given, (of which, however, the master rarely
partakes,) while his conduct and behaviour on
such occasions can afford but a slight insight
into the domestic manners of the people when
free from that constraint, which the eye of a
stranger, who is generally treated, if not considered
as a superior, throws upon all their
actions.</p>

<hr class='c031' />

<p class='c008'>‘With the native women, of any rank in society,
the European has not the most distant
communication. It will be observed, therefore,
how impossible it is for an European to speak
from his own personal knowledge of the familiar
manners of the native of Hindostan. The following
sketch is collected from the various
accounts received from sensible and respectable
people of different ranks in society. It will
probably correct some prejudices respecting the
fair sex in Eastern countries, or at least afford
some reasonable explanation of the manner in
which they are treated. Their confinement is
in general solely ascribed to the jealousy of the
husband, and to the number of wives allowed
to one man, to which the voluptuousness of a
warm climate is supposed to conduce. But, in
speaking themselves of the confinement of their
women, they offer the following reasons for the
custom, viz. the variety of tribes, and intermixture
of strange people; the instability of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>government, and consequent confusion in the
country, requiring that their families should be
placed in secure places; the tyranny of their
former rulers and their favorites, with whom it
was no unusual occurrence to seize by force the
wives of others; and, lastly, because a passage
in the Koran<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c030'><sup>[2]</sup></a> seems to recommend a reserved
deportment in women. It says, ‘You shall not
shew your <em>zeenut</em><a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c030'><sup>[3]</sup></a> to any one except your husband,
your own father, or your husband’s; (the
present custom in Bengal precludes him;) your
own son, or your husband’s son; or your brother,
or his son, or your sister’s son; or your
own female servants, being of your own faith;
or your male servants of the following description:
such as old men, eunuchs, debilitated
men, or fools, who think of nothing but eating,
or little children, unto such are you allowed to
shew your <em>zeenut</em><a href='#f3' class='c030'><sup>[3]</sup></a>.’ Such exceptions from so
sacred an authority, which leaves little but the
fingers and toes for general inspection, would
seem to render the seclusion of a Mussulman
lady a matter of necessity, not choice.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Neither the husbands, nor the wives, will,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>by any means, allow jealousy to be the cause;
for they say, ‘Were a woman viciously inclined,
even encircled by walls of iron, she would, by
some contrivance or other, find means for accomplishing
her purpose. It is not,’ say they,
‘against such their precautions are aimed: it is,
that the minds of those who are really pure may
not be contaminated through the force of bad
example; and, that women, being naturally
weak, and easily led astray, as may be inferred
from the story of poor Eve, it becomes the duty
of the husbands to guard them from the flowery
paths of temptation.’ Such, indeed, is the
force of education, that a lady of Hindostan, of
decent parentage, would rather suffer death than
exposure to public view. In imprecating the
greatest evils on the head of an enemy, a female
could not conceive any term so severe as those
which conveyed a wish that the veil of concealment
might be rent asunder. However, notwithstanding
the seclusion of the ladies is so
much talked of, and deemed so harsh, it will,
probably, on investigation, be found, that the
prohibition extends only to such as could have
but a slight intercourse with them, even if the
full influence of social communication obtained.
Their rules respecting <em>muhrem</em> and <em>na muhrem</em>,
words implying <em>forbidden</em> and <em>not forbidden</em>, are,
in their principle, simple enough, viz. ‘That a
woman may be seen by any man whose relationship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>to her precludes marriage’; though custom
has established many deviations from this rule;
all which seem to have arisen, not from jealousy,
but from a mistaken sense of modesty.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘In the upper provinces, all the brothers visit
each other’s wives without distinction; but, in
Bengal, only those junior to the husband. Indeed,
in Bengal, the distinctions of <em>muhrem</em>,
and <em>na muhrem</em>, are so whimsical, and amount
to such a mixture of Hindu superstition and
Mahomedan prejudice, as would render a detailed
account of them disgusting to the reader.
I shall therefore comprize what I have to say on
the subject in as few words as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘A wife, even in Bengal, may enjoy the society
of all her own male relations. In this light
are considered <em>chellas</em>, children brought up in the
family, and the relations of the nurse; the nurse
being considered as standing in the same relationship
as the natural parents; and often, among
the great in the upper provinces, where two
females are solicitous to form an intimate connection,
it is accomplished, as completely as
marriage could do it, by obtaining a female of
one family to suckle a child belonging to the
other. Male friends, of the respectable class,
though never permitted to see each other’s wives,
make enquiries after the ladies’ healths, send
and receive compliments, and are sometimes
permitted (with the precaution of the curtain)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>to free and unrestrained conversation. It may
be seen from the above, that the circle of a lady’s
male acquaintance may be much more extensive
than Europeans would in general suppose; for,
taking advantage of the spirit of the regulations,
and waiving the more preposterous, half a dozen
sisters might enjoy the society of a number of
men, little less limitted than falls to the lot of
most ladies of the middle ranks in colder climates;
and it must be remembered, that, what
is said here generally applies to the middle ranks,
including the lesser <em>Ameers</em>.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c030'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>‘In the upper provinces, the ladies and gentlemen,
at least among the <em>Sheeaus</em>,<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c030'><sup>[5]</sup></a> generally eat
together; but in Bengal this is not the case;
there the wife does not even presume to eat in
the husband’s presence, and never partakes of
any of his amusements. In the upper provinces
the social qualities are better understood; for
when the company consists of persons admissible
into the <em>zenanah</em>, they all go in; the men
and women dine together, and, in general, sit on
opposite sides. The ladies, like ours, indulge in
<em>tiffings</em>, (slight repasts,) it being delicate to eat
but little before company.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When there is an assemblage of fair visitors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>the husband seldom enters the <em>zenanah</em>, that he
may not disturb their amusements, which, when
unobserved by men, take a free range. The wife
never mentions her husband by name. This
respect, as it is termed, is reciprocal. Indeed,
people in general avoid addressing each other
by name, substituting some title; as ‘your ladyship;’
or by the name of a favorite child, as
‘William’s mother;’ or by a periphrasis. It is
so strictly observed by some wives, that they
would not mention an indifferent matter by the
same name as their husband is called by.
Should, for instance, the husband’s name be
‘<em>Year</em>,’ the wife would say, ‘I am sixteen
twelvemonths old,’ rather than sixteen ‘years.’
However, this excessive nicety will only be
found among villagers.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Some <em>ladies</em> pride themselves much in the arts
of needle-work and cookery: excellence in the
former being deemed a good criterion to form a
judgment of a lady’s education: a wife, therefore,
who did not take upon herself the whole
internal management of the household, would
be held in great disrepute. They are, in general,
allowed a certain sum yearly for cloaths, and all
expences of the house within doors, from which,
by good management, they often save considerable
sums of money, and, in times of distress,
when the inconsiderate husband thinks his all is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>gone, often does his wife relieve his distresses
from her little treasury.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘In addition to the established allowance, there
are other fixed sums appropriated. In their
holidays, which frequently occur, dinner is always
dressed within the <em>zenanah</em>, except upon
occasions of great feasts and entertainments,
when, of course, the arrangement must be
made by men. When only a few friends are
expected, the wife, being informed of their
number and rank, issues her orders accordingly,
through her female attendants, to the male servants
of the house. The education of the daughters,
and sons also, whilst young, is entirely
entrusted to the mother. Should one of the
former forget those lessons of chastity, and of
correctness of behaviour, which it is her
mother’s constant solicitude to impress on her
mind; nay, should her conduct even be such as
to create suspicion; immediate death from the
hand of the parent would be the consequence.
I am speaking here of rather the higher orders;
for people in the middle ranks of life
are more restrained in their conduct, more
within the reach of the law, and, besides, the
point of honor which acts with such force
in high-minded families, loses its impetus with
them.—Such is the influence the women possess
in Hindostan, that, whenever <em>Soonees</em> <a id='corr353.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='and and'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_353.29'><ins class='correction' title='and and'>and</ins></a></span>

<p class='c008'>‘At all marriages, (the ceremonies of which
will be hereafter detailed,) or on the occurrence
of much-wished-for events, such as the return
of a son safely from the wars, the recovery of a
lost child, &amp;c., or when a lady wishes to be
enrolled among the <em>naik zuns</em>, or <em>pure matrons</em>, a
feast is given in honor of Fatima, the daughter
of the Prophet, which is termed <em>kundooree</em>, a
word implying <em>off-falls</em>.—No woman can partake
of this feast, unless she be of the purest morals;
and it is generally imagined, that an impure
person, even tasting the sacred food prepared
on that occasion, would surely die. The lady
who gives the feast, performs menial offices to
the guests, such as washing their feet, &amp;c. The
victuals served up, consists of such articles as
Fatima is supposed to have preferred, viz. rice,
ghee, sugar, pulse, and vegetables. A share is
sent to the men; but not of that set apart for
the offering; of which the pure matrons may
alone partake. To be considered as such, a
woman must have regularly kept all the annual
feasts, and be married; or, if a virgin, she
must then at least disclaim all intentions of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>changing her condition. No woman contracted
in marriage only for a time, such as the <em>moota</em><a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c030'><sup>[7]</sup></a>
of the <em>Sheeaus</em>, and the <em>nekaw</em><a href='#f7' class='c030'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of the <em>Soonees</em>,
can be admitted. The word <em>nekaw</em>, among the
vulgar, implies, but improperly, the secondary
kind of marriage. No woman, who has married
a second time, though she may not have
conversed with the first husband, can partake of
the <em>kundooree</em>.</p>

traces of their original character perceptible).
An earlier period is frequently fixed on, where
purposes of interest and policy may be answered.
Old maids, at least among the great, are not at
all uncommon; caused by a kind of false pride,
or I know not what to term it, of the parents,
who cannot bear that their daughters’ nakedness
should be known to any one. Nadir Shah, it
is said, either from a prejudice of this nature,
or more probably from a jealousy of too highly
honoring any of his subjects, destroyed all his
female children, which were extremely numerous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>immediately on their birth, except one;
who was concealed from him till she had attained
her thirteenth year. It was then contrived
that she should be brought into his presence.
She is said to have been all that was
beautiful in nature! She flew to his embrace,
which he fondly returned, ignorant that he
clasped his own daughter. But, when this devoted
child addressed him as her father, the hardened
monster seized the innocent victim by the
legs, and kept her head immersed in a fountain
till she expired! Such an account, even of the
unfeeling Nadir Shah, is scarcely to be credited;
but the story may shew the name he has left
behind him in Hindostan.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The late vizier, Asoph ul Dowlah, left about
thirty sisters unmarried; not that I believe <em>his</em>
delicacy would have suffered from any such fastidious
notions as above alluded to; their celibacy
was owing to the difficulty of obtaining
suitable matches for women of their rank; which,
in the present state of the country, must be
almost impracticable.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Reading and writing are not usual accomplishments
with the ladies of Hindostan. Among
the great, there are, however, some who read
such books as the Koran, &amp;c. and some few
who write; but of all delightful intercourse by
letter they are entirely debarred; it being deemed
indecent even for a wife directly to address
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>her husband; therefore, whether she employ an
amanuensis to pen a letter, or be capable of transcribing
it herself, it must be written as from a
third person; such as a son, or near relation.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Among the better order, about ten in a
hundred can read the Koran; but it must not
be understood by reading, that they thence
comprehend one single word of it; that book
being to them, what our Bible, in a Latin version,
must formerly have been to our common people.
The mode of passing their time, though apparently
not affording all that variety which an
European lady enjoys, is not devoid of amusement.
They generally rise, or should do so,
at daybreak; that they may have time to purify
themselves before the rising of the sun, at
which time the first prayer is repeated.—After
prayers, the important business at the toilette
commences, in which, as is usual among ladies,
two or three hours, at least, are <em>profitably</em> spent.
The <em>missee</em> is applied to the feet and sweet-smelling
oils, &amp;c. to the body; while their
flowing ringlets (those nets which entangle
unhappy lovers, and which their poets are so
fond of describing) are now nicely adjusted.
In short, the toilette is become with them a
perfect art, and much of a young lady’s time is
engrossed in attending to instructions on this
head. After the toilette, comes the breakfast;
which does not, like ours, consist of fixed articles,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>but varies agreeably to the taste of the
parties, and to the management of the mistress.
It will not appear unnecessary to observe, that
they never use knives or spoons; and, indeed,
they seem to think that we lose much of the
relish of the food by the artificial aids we employ
on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘After breakfast, and having issued the necessary
orders for dinner, the lady of the house,
attended by her daughters and slave-girls, sits
down to needle-work; an excellence on which,
as well as all kinds of embroidery, they greatly
pride themselves. Among the middle ranks,
such as can write, often employ themselves in
copying the Koran, which, when compleated,
is either sold for, or given to, some poor person,
to be converted into property more needful to
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The sound of the <em>cherky</em>, or spinning wheel,
is always considered indicative of poverty, and
is therefore seldom heard in the houses of the
great; but women of a middling class, often

thread, intended to be wove into mulmuls, &amp;c.
for their own apparel. The coarser skeans
being allotted to their <em>baundees</em>, or female slaves.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Between twelve and one they generally
dine, every person washing the face and hands

table-<em>cloth</em>; which is spread on the ground, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>around which all the party arrange themselves:
except it be among the Bengal Mussulmans, or
among such as have adopted the Hindu manners,
by whom a wife is not permitted to eat
in the presence of her husband. This meal
generally consists of boiled rice, or of wheaten
cakes, stewed or <em>curried</em> vegetables. Curry is
made of fowls, kid, and goats’ flesh. Beef is
seldom sought after, except in cities; and
mutton is by most considered as an inflating,
unwholesome food. The head, heart, lights,
feet, &amp;c. of animals, are rejected. The dinner
is usually divided into as many shares as
the company consists of, and brought in that
way from the cook-room; except on great occasions,
when the servant serves it out. They
have no change of plates until the sweetmeats
are brought in. Tooth-picks, and the wash-hand
bason, are presented to each, except there should
be a large company; in that case, they perform
the ablution apart.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘They have not the custom of any particular
person saying <em>grace</em> before or after meals; each
repeating in a low voice the <em>name of God</em>. After
meals, thanks are returned by the male part,
but not by the female: a curious distinction!
the reason for which, my Mussulman narrator
ungallantly alleges to spring from the nature of
woman in general. Immediately after dinner,
the parties retire to take their afternoon-nap; on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>arising from which the toilette again engages the
ladies’ attention. Disengaged from it, they walk
round their gardens (which are enclosed,) to
enjoy the evening air. After sun-set, when the
evening prayers are over, the relations and
friends visit each other; and this is the hour in
which the husband withdraws himself from
general intrusion, and retires to the <em>zenanah</em>.
Here, surrounded by his wife and children, he
enjoys the pleasing converse of the one, and
the innocent diversions of the other. The
young folks of both sexes play at <em>blindman’s
buff</em>, and such-like sports, which are generally
succeeded by the proposing of enigmas, the
narration of enchanting tales, unpremeditated
rhymes, and other various, and not unuseful,
exhibitions of wit. In such disports, great
part of the night glides away unnoticed, as the
female visitors do not return home till the next
morning. Games are not much encouraged
among them. <em>Patchees</em>, a game in high vogue
among the ladies, is, I believe, the only one
allowed. The word means twenty-five. The
game is played with <em>cowries</em>, which answer for
dice.</p>

than two. Even the permission given by Mahomed
is not free from restriction; for his
words are, ‘Marry, O ye people, whomsoever
pleases you among women, even to two, three,
or four: but, if ye apprehend that you cannot do
them justice, be content with one.’ This considerate
advice of the prophet however would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>probably carry but small weight, if there did not
exist other obstacles, not so easily surmounted;
for it frequently forms a clause in the <em>quballa</em>,<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c030'><sup>[9]</sup></a>
(or <em>cabooleat</em>,) in a marriage contract, that the
husband shall not take a second wife: besides,
no parent, possessed of a proper regard for his
child, would willingly place her in that degraded
situation a second wife is always considered to
be; and subjected, as she is, to the entire control
of the first; who, it may be supposed, must,
from various motives, in general prove a harsh
and unpleasant mistress. Neither ought we to
be led away by the idea that any influence of the
husband will prevent such consequences; for
the wives of Hindostan, however problematical
it may sound, will be found to have, in reality,
even more power than those of Europe. It is
true, a husband is allowed by law the privilege
of divorcing his wife whenever displeased with
her conduct; and this, on the first glance, appears
to leave no alternative but implicit obedience
in the woman: but it will be found otherwise,
in fact; for the relations of the bride take
care, in the marriage-settlement, that the <em>mahir</em>,
or marriage-portion, payable in case of separation,
shall be fixed at an amount far exceeding
the circumstances of the husband to pay; which,
of course, proves an effectual check to a divorcement.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>In addition to this, general opinion strongly
opposes a separation, though not a second marriage,
where there exists no sufficient cause to
justify the step; such as barrenness, chronic
disease, &amp;c., in the woman.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Wherever there are two or more wives, an
equal distribution of favors is rigidly insisted on,
(unless the secondary one happens to be of inferior
rank;) yet, let it not be inferred that any
lady could be so lost to delicacy as to urge her
claims in direct terms. The sex have always
the command of general signs, whereby to intimate
their expectations in the most delicate
manner. But, though jealous of her rights, a
wife of rank and education would, during the
whole period of her existence, deem it highly
indelicate to neglect, in the most secluded moments,
a modest reluctance to comply with the
solicitations of her husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Among the slave-girls, there are always two
or three who are considered as the handmaids of
the husband, and with whom, even by their religion,
an intercourse is permitted: however, this
must be conducted in a concealed manner. They,
too, aping the manners of their mistresses, are
not always at the command of the master; and
I have been assured, by men of eminence and
affluence among them, that, even in the midst of
plenty, they have suffered all the tantalization of
want.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>‘It is said, that Soojah Dowlah, whenever he
paid a visit to any other lady, always imposed on
himself a fine of two thousand rupees, which
he sent to his wife. The prophet himself had
only five wives, one of whom he preferred
to all the rest; yet, though much inclined, he
durst not visit her oftener than the others; two
of whom, however, he ventured to divorce, that
the period of his enjoyment might more quickly
revolve.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘A wife may, in certain cases, insist on a
divorce, such as inefficacy in the husband, &amp;c.
under which circumstances she receives the
marriage-portion. It must be remarked, that,
although the <em>mahir</em> is always fixed in the marriage
articles, yet that there does not exist any
method of settling it on the wife independently,
as among us; therefore, this settlement consists
only of terms, except in cases of divorce. The
word <em>mahir</em> means, literally, the price paid for
any thing.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘A wife never brings a dowry to her husband,
except her plentiful stock may be so considered,
such as cloaths, jewels, &amp;c., which her parents
send with her, sometimes to so great an extent,
as to preclude for years the necessity of any supply
from the husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When a divorce occurs, even on the demand
of the wife, the husband is obliged to support
her as long as any possibility remains of her affording
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>nourishment to his offspring; and, should
she then be pregnant, the allowance must be
continued to her, agreeably to her rank in life,
until the period of her delivery, when the child
is taken from her; unless she chooses to support
it at her own expence, and is allowed to do so
by the father.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Should a man catch his wife in the act of
adultery, and revenge himself by the death of
both parties, the Mahomedan law would acquit
him of murder; but, should he take the life of
only one of the offenders, they would sentence
him to death. The laws of the Koran, relative
to trials for adultery, one would almost think
were framed with the sole view of prohibiting
such suits; for, whereas, in common cases, two
respectable male witnesses are deemed competent
to establish a fact; in cases of adultery, four
male witnesses must be produced. The testimony
of a thousand women would be of no avail,
and that of the men must be clear and circumstantial.
The smallest disagreement would invalidate
the depositions of the whole. In short,
such are the difficulties, or rather impossibilities,
the law throws in the way of substantiating
the charge, that causes of the score of adultery,
or of fornication, are seldom heard of.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘They seem not to have distinguished these
two crimes by different appellations, though the
punishment is different. For the first, the criminal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>is stoned to death; for the second, a hundred
lashes are deemed an adequate punishment.
So the award to a married man and unmarried
woman, convicted of <em>zinnah,</em> (a general term
for unlawful co-habitation,) would be death to
the man, and flagellation to the woman. Such
is the law; but custom has left the injured parties
to pursue private measures of revenge, in
which the courts never interfere.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Mutual intercourse among female friends and
relations is kept up by visits; for which, however,
previous permission from the husbands
must be obtained, except when the wife intends
a visit to her parents. In such a case, she <em>intimates</em>
her intention; and, though he may dissuade,
he has not the power to restrain. When
first informed of this privilege, so contrary to
received opinion, it excited my surprize, which
I evinced by minute enquiry. The following is
the answer I received from a person of rank and
character: ‘A wife’ (said he) ‘is not a slave
to a husband. He is her guardian, it is true;
and, when she pursues a path that would lead to
disgrace, it is his duty to control her, on common
occasions, by advice: should that prove ineffectual,
her relatives are informed of her refractoriness,
and they lend their aid. If still untractable,
she may be confined to her room. He may abstain
from her bed; but where is the Mussulman
of character that would lift his hand to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>wife of his bosom? Is he devoid of all regard to
his own honor, that he should treat the mother
of his children with disgrace? or has he become
regardless of the good opinion of his brethren?
or could he, for a moment, forget that her relations,
to a man, would start forward to resent an
insult offered to their family? No man’ (continued
he) ‘can, with impunity, oppose that
general opinion which has for its foundation both
propriety and justice. A wife must, therefore,
be permitted to visit her parents whenever she is
inclined to do so.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘It must appear curious, however, that custom
has made it indecent for her to return, without
an invitation from her husband! This may produce
considerable effect, when a mutual regard,
or children, attach them to each other; but,
while the lady continues young, if she be any
way coquetish and takes a pleasure, as is sometimes
the case, to teaze her husband, she will,
under various pretexts, continue obdurate for
months, until his patience, and his ample stock
of promises of future kindness, are expended.
In short, the Hindostanee ladies are possessed of
a thousand arts whereby to secure their influence,
and to domineer over the <em>lords of creation</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘In the absence of her husband, a wife, though
she may receive, pays no visits. When the
women travel, or move from one house to another,
they are concealed with all the precaution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>generally attributed to an Eastern journey; their
palanquins are carefully shut up, and attended,
when the rank of the person demands it, by
guards composed of eunuchs, and sometimes
by armed women, who are called, from their
countries, Toorknees, Zillmaknees, Oorda-Bignees,
&amp;c. This jealous care, however, is not
taken by all classes. The Rohillas, for instance,
are less scrupulous: among themselves, their
women travel unveiled, and without ceremony.
Indeed, among the northern nations, we can
trace but little of that guarded precaution so
conspicuous in the cities of Hindostan.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘No ceremony is observed at the naming of a
child. The parents choose a name, which habit
soon confirms. The great are credulous, and
often call in an astrologer, who is mostly a
Bramin, to cast the child’s nativity, and to fix
on, or to approve of, a name; but this is not
usual, nor is feasting, nor merry-making, as at
our christenings.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘A son is at no age debarred from freely
entering the <em>zenanah</em>, though it may contain
numbers of women not at all related to him;
and, should the encreased bulk of any of the
slave-girls shew symptoms of his attention, it
will hardly be deemed a crime in either party.
However, as the parents are solicitous to prevent
such an intercourse, they rarely fail to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>provide the young gentleman with a wife, so
early as circumstances will admit. Should this
be delayed, a slave-girl would be allowed him, but
the intercourse must proceed in such a manner,
as if the parents were ignorant of the affair; the
progeny from this connection would be received
into the family on equal terms with those born
in wedlock; being once acknowledged, they are
entitled to every privilege of inheritance. Primogeniture,
among the Mahomedans, gives no
superior claims to their real, or personal property:
the division of the estate is easy, for a
son gets double the share of a daughter.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The evidence of women of rank is taken by
male relations, or by women properly authorized
by the <em>Cazee</em><a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c030'><sup>[10]</sup></a> for that purpose; but female testimony
is inadmissible in cases of life and death.
A woman of rank never suffers public punishment,

her disgrace, would themselves cause her death;

<p class='c008'>‘Widows seldom take a second husband,
though allowed to do so. Young widows are

suckle their own children. In the choice
of a wet-nurse, they are extremely particular,
as all her family are by that means considered in
the light of relations; a custom so far adhered to,
as to preclude the possibility of intermarriage
between the child thus suckled, and the children
of its nurse.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Women in India never go to public baths.
Each house in general is furnished with hot and
cold baths. Where the former cannot be afforded,
a boiler is always in readiness. Bathing is
commanded as a necessary purification after
most of the common occurrences of life. So
much so, that most married ladies, under certain
circumstances, are obliged to perform the ablution
even in the middle of the night; and, as in
these ceremonies if the parties are at all particular,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>it requires the hair to be wet, it affords

<p class='c008'>‘The present fashionable dress of our fair
country-women, having had for its object the
imitation of the Hindostanee, might be supposed
to preclude the necessity of a particular
description, did not the same inconstancy equally
pervade their taste. Within these few years,
the shoes with the long-turned-up tops have
been introduced and abolished, in consequence
(as the story goes,) of a lady in Asoph ud Doulah’s
<em>haram</em> being thrown down by the entanglement
of the string of a kite round the curvature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>of her shoe. The <em>n’hut</em>, or large ring, worn at
the nose, is also going out of fashion: indeed,
considering the inconvenience that must have
been experienced from this ornament, it is
strange it should so long have continued in use.
The disuse of it is accounted for in the following
manner. On the death of a married woman,
or of her husband, (for no widows wear it,) this
ornament, according to long-established usage,
becomes the property of the <em>meeraseens</em>, a particular
kind of <em>nautch</em> women. A lady of
Oude, of a delicate way of thinking, being in
possession of a <em>n’hut</em> of great value and elegance,
thought she observed the longing eye of the
<em>meeraseens</em> continually fixed on this jewel; and,
dreading the effects of their envy on her own
life, or on that of her husband, took off the <em>n’hut</em>
and threw it away; a circumstance that created
much consternation in the family, and
astonishment in the husband, as it had hitherto
been deemed a necessary part of a married
woman’s dress, and was guarded with as much
superstitious care as the marriage-ring among us.
However, the explanation of her motives set all
to rights again; the husband applauded her
prudence, and the neighbouring families, taking
up the same idea, the long-established rights of
the <em>meeraseens</em> in that part of the country suffered
almost total abolishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The dress of the ladies of rank has become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>comparatively simple, and seems to evince a
considerable improvement in the national taste.
Instead of both ears being weighed down, as
was formerly the case, they now only wear a
slight ornamented ring in the left ear, in general.
The having both ears ornamented they consider
as the height of vulgarity. A pearl necklace,
slight golden rings at the wrists and ancles,
termed <em>zewaree ichanjeeree</em>, include all the
ornaments worn by a lady of fashion. For the
wrists they prefer silken bracelets, decorated
with jewels. The hair, which was brought
down over the brow in two semi-circles, so as
almost to bear on the eye, is divided as before,
but not permitted to conceal any part of the
forehead.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The <em>pyjama</em>, or drawers, were formerly worn
so tight, as to render it a work of some labor
to get them on. Indeed, to such a length
did this taste go at one time, that many of
the famous courtezans had themselves painted
in imitation of <em>keemkab</em><a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c030'><sup>[13]</sup></a> from the waist downwards.
In the upper provinces, they are now
made to fit exactly above the knee, but from
thence downwards quite loose, and so long as
to press on the shoe. In the lower provinces,
the exact reverse takes place. In Bengal, it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>deemed immodest to wear the <em>ungeeas</em>, or supporters
to the breast. In the upper provinces,
a woman would be ashamed to be seen without
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The <em>coortee</em>, or kind of banian, must be of
the thinnest muslin, so that the tapering waist,
which they so much admire, and of which our
ladies now deny us the view, may be distinctly
seen. The sleeves short, and the <em>coortee</em> itself so
much so, that the <em>nicfa</em>, a different colored cloth
at the top of the <em>pyjama</em>, may not be concealed,
the <em>doo-puttah</em>, or two breadths of muslin,
formed into the shape of a scotch plaid, and
worn nearly in the same manner, is thrown over
the whole.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The <em>paishwaz</em>, meaning <em>open in front</em>, is not
now in fashion. This is the robe from which our
ladies have taken their present dress, but which
they have modestly closed before, having no
painted <em>keemkabs</em> to shew. Petticoats, (called
<em>bandanas</em>,) are sometimes worn by Mahomedan
ladies, especially in the rainy season, when the
diversion of <em>swinging</em> commences, but never
without drawers under them.—Widows should
not wear cloaths stained with any but what are
termed <em>pukka</em>, or lasting colors; nor should
these be of the glaring kind. Their <em>pyjamas</em>
must always be white, which a married lady
never wears.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘On the commencement of the seventh, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>Bengal, and the ninth month up the country, of
pregnancy, it is usual to give a great entertainment
to the friends of the parties; on which
occasion the mistress of the feast is decked with
flowers, and dressed with new cloaths and ornaments.
One of the females, to whom Lucinda
may have been more propitious than to the rest,
comes forward with a present, consisting of
seven kinds of fruits, and of the flower of rice,
kneaded into round and oval pieces: this part
of the ceremony is confined to Bengal. The
first is said to be emblematic of girls, the latter
of boys. This offering is poured out into the pregnant
lady’s lap, who, without tasting the fruits
herself, distributes them among the company.
This feast, if practicable, is given at her father’s
house, where the lady is generally delivered.
Here the midwife attends, who is seldom, or can
be, expert in her business. Hence, unlucky
births are very frequent. I need not
observe, that males never officiate in this line;
however, the old ladies sometimes, in dangerous
cases, venture to perform chirurgical operations.
A few lines from the Koran, sent by some celebrated
religionist, and placed at the bed-head,
or a little water sanctified by being poured on
the <span class='sc'>Koran</span>, is supposed to be wonderfully
efficacious; but, in difficult births, some person,
woman, boy, or girl, who has been fortunate
enough to come feet foremost into the world, is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>called in to jump seven times over the womb
of the person in labor. On these occasions, all
the keys are taken out of the locks, doors opened,
boxes unlocked, and a sword hung up in some
part of the room, to frighten away the evil
demons. If the danger encreases, the husband
opens his turban, and spreads it over the
patient’s womb, and then makes it up the wrong
way. They have a stone called <em>k’ho</em>, or the
<em>power of seals</em>, which is tied about the neck, and
many other superstitious practices; the same
as in all countries, among the common people.
The child being born, the rooms are kept as
close as possible, and it is not permitted to get
milk for three days. During the first six, the
mother tastes nothing but light caudle. On the
night of the sixth, the child is brought to the
door, that the starlight may shine upon it.
Pen and ink are placed at the head of the bed,
that the angel of fate may write on its forehead
its future destiny. The first ablution is performed
by the lady on the fortieth day. When
the child is four months old, a feast called <em>keer
chittaee</em> is given, to which all friends and relations
are invited. <em>Keer</em> is a preparation of rice
and milk, which the child is now made to taste,

<p class='c008'>‘It is a general custom among the <em>Soozees</em><a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c030'><sup>[17]</sup></a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>both men and women, to choose some holy man
to be their guide and instructor, (not dissimilar
to the office of a confessor,) whom they call their
<em>peer</em>;<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c030'><sup>[18]</sup></a> designating themselves his <em>mooreed</em>, or
disciple. When a lady of rank has fixed on this
holy personage for her <em>peer</em>, he is invited to the
house, where the following ceremony ensues.
Standing on the outside of the <em>purdah</em>, or curtain,
he holds one end of a handkerchief, the
other end of which is held by his intended <em>mooreed</em>
within the <em>purdah</em>. In this position he reads
aloud select passages from the <cite>Koran</cite>, allusive to
the subject, and finishes with a lecture on morality.
Thus adopted, he is thenceforward to her
as her God and the prophet. In all difficult
situations, she looks to him for relief, calling on
his name in danger; and the death of the <em>peer</em>
does not even dissolve the contract. After the
first ceremony, the <em>peer</em> seldom visits his <em>mooreed</em>;
indeed, as thousands may choose the same spiritual
guide, such duty would prove too much
even for his <em>spirit</em> to bear. However, there are
instances of a <em>peer</em> being chosen from motives
very different from what may be supposed in
general to operate; hence, we sometimes discover,
that, under the cover of a <em>peer</em>, the lady
indulges herself with a private lecture from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>young <em>lover</em>. Indeed, the <em>Sheeaus</em> give this as
a reason for their discontinuance of the practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Fatima, the Prophet’s daughter, is invoked
under different appellations. Her general name
is <em>Khatoon ul junet</em>, or <em>Mistress of Paradise</em>.
There are, besides, several male saints, whose
peculiar province is the protection of the fair
sex; but <em>Peer Bawhoor</em>, is the hastener of
lovers’ return. Among the lower ranks, <em>Shaik
Saddoo</em> is often invoked. This was a good and
great man, whom the devil tempted in the shape
of a beautiful young lady; and, as he happened
to die before he had time for purification, he
was (as is <em>usual in such cases</em>,) turned into a
<em>kubbeess</em>, or wandering wicked spirit, of whom
the women are much afraid; for he is said often
to enter them in the shape of the devil, such as
in the times of our forefathers were used to possess
the females. They give great feasts in
honor of <em>Shaik Saddoo</em>, at which a goat forms
part of the sacrifice. Hence, when a woman is
in her tantrums, she is ironically said to require
a slice of the <em>Shaik’s goat</em>. At the entertainment
given in his honor, one of the women personates
the <em>Shaik</em>, being dressed in male habiliments,
and furnished with sword and target.
When a woman is said to be possessed, she undergoes
all the agitations of the prophetic beldames
of former times; she foams at the mouth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>and appears in strong convulsions. In this deplorable
situation, true answers are supposed to
be received to all questions put to her relating
to past, or to future events. Some women affect
to be married to this saint, and, consequently,
become very, very devils to their husbands and
neighbours. <em>Zaen Khan</em>, particularly in the
upper provinces, is a saint of a similar complexion
and history. One of the <em>bhaguts</em>, or
doctors, famous for his dexterity in exorcism,
gave me the following detail of his proceedings.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When a woman appears heavy and unwell,
her friends, suspecting the cause, call in a <em>bhagut</em>,
who generally, as may be imagined, accords
with them in opinion. On hearing this sentence
from so learned a personage, the patient’s imagination
begins to operate, and, in a short while,
she feels the spirit move within her. The <em>bhagut</em>
loses no time in making up a magic sacrifice,
which he sets on the fire under the woman’s
nose. The devil being thus smoked out, loses
no time in mounting upon the body of the patient,
and begins (permit me the use of a vulgar,
though not inapplicable term) to ride away “at
a devil of a rate.” The patient now suffers violent
agitation, tossing her arms, head, and legs
about, in a dreadful manner, in consequence of
the kicks and buffetings from the fiend; who all
this while is totally invisible to every one except
the <em>bhagut</em>. This is the moment for the display
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>of the doctor’s art and dexterity! He springs
forward, and seizes the <em>possessed</em> by the hair;
which he holds fast, as it gives him an entire
command over the spirit, whom he now interrogates
in the following peremptory and bold manner:—“Who
art thou? whence comest thou?
and why disturbest thou this woman?”</p>

<p class='c008'>‘To these queries, the fiend, through the
mouth of the <em>possessed</em>, makes answer, “Be it
known to you, that I inhabit a certain tree,”
specifying one in the neighbourhood; “and that,
being on my rambles, in passing this female, I
espied her body to be <em>pure</em> and <em>undefiled</em>, and fit
for habitation; therefore I entered into it.” The
fiend now offers to quit his habitation, if it be
the <em>bhagut’s</em> pleasure; which, after some ceremony,
is done. The doctor now receives his
fee, and, were it not for the fear of spoiling
trade, before his departure, probably would advise
the husband not to permit his wife to have
too long intervals of undefilement in future, lest
the devil should again take possession of her!</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When speaking of the ornamental parts of
the ladies’ dress, mention was not made of their
blackening the eyelids with antimony. This
practice is supposed, besides giving additional
brilliancy to the eyes, to preserve and improve
the sight. But, as in that country there is no
antimony to be found, they employ in its stead
a lead ore, unconscious of the difference; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>such, as cannot even afford the ore, use <em>caugull</em>,
or lamp-black. One reason given for this predilection
to antimony is, that, when Mount-Sinai
was set on fire by lightning from above,
the whole was transfused into that semi-metal;
thence their belief that it is not to be found in
any other region of the earth. It will naturally
be supposed, that this is a singular story, gaining
belief only among the ignorant; but, though
their men of learning, and science, cannot be
comprized under that appellation, yet it may
once for all be observed, that all their ridiculous
tales, of which they have abundance, gain equal
credit among people of all ranks. Rich and
poor, learned and unlearned, the <em>cazee</em> and tipstaff,
the <em>peer</em> and <em>mooreed</em>, are equally credulous,
and very few, if any, instances indeed
will be found, wherein they are above the most
preposterous prejudices; still, many from interest,
and some who choose not to encounter the
taunts of Europeans, will, in their presence, affect
to be free from the prejudices of the vulgar.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Besides the antimony to the eyes, the women
apply a black stain to the teeth, called
<em>missee</em>: it is made of the rust of iron and <em>kurra</em>
compounded.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c030'><sup>[19]</sup></a> It is, in fact, ink-powder: for
the <em>kurra</em> is a <em>nut</em> equally astringent with galls.
The powder is rubbed on, or rather between,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>the teeth, and leaves a black stain, which is
deemed both a preservation and an ornament to
them. The use of the plant <em>hinna</em>,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c030'><sup>[20]</sup></a> has been
described by travellers in all Eastern countries.
The leaves are pounded and mixed up into a
paste, which is applied to their nails, palms,
and soles; after an adherence of a few hours, it
is shaken off, and leaves a beautiful red stain,
which lasts many days. It is supposed to have
a cooling quality.</p>

The most respectable are the <em>meeraseen</em>, sometimes

never do. The word <em>meeras</em> means an <em>inheritance</em>,
and <em>meeraseen</em> an <em>inheritress</em>, from the custom
that has obtained in families of never changing
the set. Indeed, custom has so far established
it as a right, that any deviation would be

always consider their first lover as their real
husband, during the rest of their lives; and, on
his death, though they should be married to another,
they leave off their pursuits for a prescribed
period, and mourn agreeably to the custom
of widows. They do not consider any part

master even to inflict death on some of the most

like a swarm of bees, many of them to
misery and distress. The handsomest are usually
selected by the heir, for his own use; while
such as may have superior attractions, though
they may even have been the favored mistresses

established rule to turn them out when the
family retires to bed, to seek husbands for themselves.
These women generally attach themselves
to some particular persons; and whatever
progeny arises from this intercourse, become
slaves of course. They are taught to dance,
sew, and embroider; and often, in cases of unlooked
for distress, the family is supported by
their labors. Thus we see, that the situation,
in general, of their slave-girls, is, of all others,
that which would meet with their own approbation.
However, the case is altered with those
immured in the <em>zenanahs</em> of nabobs, and men of

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>‘When a daughter reaches the age of fourteen,
some youth, of equal condition, makes
offers of marriage, by sending letters to the
parents, soliciting their favorable notice, (in
Bengal the father himself looks out for a proper
match,) and begging they will admit him within
the chain of relationship. This letter is forwarded
to the father in charge of some friend,
and never by the hands of a common messenger.
The higher the rank, and the greater the beauty,
of the fair one, the more numerous are the
solicitors.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The parents, consulting together, and having
made their selection, return a favorable answer
to the person approved of, and to the rest such
as the occasion demands. This is followed by a
ring, and a dress, being sent to the intended
bridegroom, which, though it gives him an assurance
of ultimate success does not accelerate
the consummation of his wishes; for he has still
a <em>Jacobian period</em> to toil through in service, and
in attentions to the parents: nor is it before he
has thus evinced his subjection to their commands,
and his devotion to their interests, that
their assent is given for the celebration of the
nuptials.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘To give publicity to that assent, and to his
own happiness on the occasion the favored youth
gives a great entertainment: the greater the expence
he incurs in preparation, the greater is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>supposed to be the force of his love. The ordinary
ceremonies take up three days (in Bengal twenty-one).
On the afternoon of the first day, about
sun-set, a cavalcade of the friends, male and
female, of the bridegroom, issue forth to present
a dress, ornaments, and fruits of all kinds, to the
bride. The bridegroom always furnishes the
marriage-dress, which arises from a refined delicacy
on both sides: on his, that he takes her for
herself alone; on her’s, or rather her parents,
that she may not appear like a loose woman, who
ornaments herself on going abroad.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The parents of the bride send him, on the
second day, a dress in return; which is received
about twelve o’clock at night, together with the
<em>hinna</em>,<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c030'><sup>[33]</sup></a> or <em>mehendy</em>, left from the bride’s hands,
which he applies to his own in their presence.
This is one criterion by which they judge of his
devotion and attachment; it being considered,
on common occasions, highly disgraceful to use
cast-off <em>mehendy</em>. On the night of the third
day, about eleven o’clock, the bridegroom, being
arrayed in the nuptial dress, and accompanied
by all his party, goes in procession, with drums,
trumpets, &amp;c., to the bride’s house, making more
parade and noise than can easily be conceived by
such as may not have been spectator of similar

met at the court of the house, where both parties
attack each other with slender branches of
trees, on which flowers are fastened. After
this kind of sport is finished the party visiting
is admitted, and offered sherbet. Each guest,
as the bowl is presented, throws in money,
according to his circumstances and rank, which
becomes the perquisite of the cup-bearer.
When about to depart, after refreshments being
offered, the visitors are crowned with garlands
of flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘On the third night, when the bridegroom
arrives to carry home the bride, he is annoyed
by a thousand tricks, passed on him by the
servants and other dependants. For instance,
the <em>darwan</em>, or porter, shuts the door on him,
and, until he supplicates much, and pays well,
there is no admittance for him. Some mount
his horse, others seize his shoes, &amp;c. none of
which are returned till the parties possessing
them receive considerable presents, and have
had the pleasure of raising a laugh against the
bridegroom.</p>

to the company that has assembled, and
obtains, in honor of the day, the first seat in
the assembly. The contract is now drawn up,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>parties. The questions being now put to the
bride, as she stands concealed behind the curtain,
whether she chooses him as her <em>vaqueel</em>?<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c030'><sup>[34]</sup></a>
and whether she is willing to enter into the proposed
contract or not? After some little delay,
to give the appearance of consultation to what
has been already arranged, she gives assent to
both questions, uttering, in a voice scarcely
audible, the final, I had almost said fatal, “Yes.”
(In Bengal, silence gives consent). The two
servants who led the <em>vaqueel</em> to the curtain, certify
the circumstance of her assent.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. <em>Vakeel</em>, as it is pronounced, literally means ambassador,
deputy or other <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>locum tenens</em></span> but here is meant to imply
protector, advocate, trustee.</p>
</div>
<hr class='c031' />

<p class='c008'>‘The <em>vaqueels</em> and relations, on both sides, now
proceed to fix on the <em>mahir</em>, (or portion;) the
adjustment of which sometimes occasions much
altercation and delay; nay, it has even been the
cause of much bloodshed, and of total suspension
of the ceremonies; but, in general, an umpire
is fixed on to determine on a medium sum,
which is inserted in the <em>cabala</em>, or marriage
contract, between the extravagant demands on
the bridegroom, and his unwillingness to comply
therewith.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The bridegroom is then conducted by the female
attendants into the presence of the bride,
who sits veiled, on a place raised on purpose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>in her own apartment. The <em>meeraseens</em> lead him
up, and seat him near her. The females of the
family, who stand behind a curtain, send him a
present of gold mohurs, rupees, &amp;c. The Koran
is now placed between the couple, and a looking-glass
is placed immediately opposite the
bride, who, on modestly refusing to unveil, is
forced thereto by the attendant <em>meeraseens</em>, so
that one ray, as my author expresses it, from
her fine countenance, may illumine the mirror,
towards which all the bridegroom’s attention is
fixed: however, this ray, transient as it is, cannot
be obtained without considerable presents
to the <em>meeraseens</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘This part of the ceremony being concluded,
permission is given to the bridegroom to convey
the bride home: her parents send with her
great quantities of cloaths, jewels, bedding,
cooking utensils, &amp;c.; and, in short, every
thing she can possibly want for years; nay, frequently,
as long as she lives. The bridegroom
and his female relations lift up the bride in their
arms, and convey her to the palanquin. On
their arrival at his house, the bearers, or carriers
of the palanquin, refuse to set down their burthen
until bribed to do so. The bridegroom takes
her out of it, and conveys her, in his arms, into an
apartment of the house, where, her feet being
bathed with rose-water, the bridegroom repeats
a thanksgiving prayer, in gratitude for her safe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>arrival, and for his own deliverance from this
scene of harassment, and trouble, which his
friends and servants force him to submit to, from
the time he quits his own house until he returns
to it with his bride: such, indeed, are the
effects of his sufferings, that often the unhappy
gentleman cannot hold up his head for some
days to come.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘On the following morning, the cloaths in
which the bride slept are sent to her parents; a
strange, indelicate custom, and highly indicative
of a total want of refinement among the
people who practise it. In the province of Bengal,
this is not done; nay, so particular are they
in avoiding the appearance of any thing of this
kind, that the bridal bed, with all its appurtenances,
is of a deep red. This day, being the
fourth from the commencement of the ceremonies,
the bride and bridegroom return to her
parents’ house, where he has admission into the
assembly of the women; and on this day the
bride appears in garments furnished by him.
(This visit, in Bengal, is not made till the fifth
day after consummation). In this assembly,
the bridegroom suffers by a general assault of
the ladies, who unmercifully pelt him with fruit,
flowers, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘On every Friday, for several weeks, the
bride pays a similar visit to her parents; receiving,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>at each visit, a new dress. On these occasions,
she never returns home until the husband’s
relations wait on her, and entreat her to
do so. For a month, at least, after the marriage,
she would be considered as deficient in
modesty were she to address her husband with
her face uncovered: and a considerable time
elapses before she appears unveiled to her other
relations. She never speaks of her husband, in
the presence of men, until she becomes a mother.
It is a curious circumstance, that her
own relations, ever after the marriage, avoid
visiting at her husband’s house, under the fastidious
apprehension of being suspected of having
bestowed the lady from motives of interest.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Should the dispositions of the pair not
accord, and the fault appear on the side of the
lady, her own relations threaten her with their
displeasure. Should this prove ineffectual, the
husband refrains from her society, though still
leaving the management of the <em>zenanah</em> in her
hands; but if, on the contrary, it appears that
their unhappiness proceeds from the husband,
her relations procure a common friend to expostulate
with him on the impropriety of his conduct.
Should it, however, after this, continue
unaltered, the wife returns to her parents, who
retain her until the husband has not only made
base submission, but has evinced the strongest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>contrition. In cases where the wife displays
any levity of conduct, her parents are more
ready than the husband to punish her.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘From the birth of a child, until they give it
the breast, it is fed with boiled cassia. On this
occasion, most of the female relations attend,

of people are from the lowest <em>casts</em>. On the
sixth day from the delivery, an entertainment is
given in the <em>zenanah</em>; when the child’s head
is shaved, and its nails cut; while money is
distributed to the poor. It may be proper to
observe, that the barber will not commence his
operations before he has received handsome presents:
sensible that he runs no risk in refusing,
as they could not, even if so inclined, prevail
on others of the tribe to officiate.—The barber,
like several other trades in Hindostan, possesses
a prescriptive right with particular families,
whose custom he considers to be an inheritance,
which cannot, without injustice, be taken from
him.</p>

<hr class='c031' />

<p class='c008'>‘On the fortieth day, a grand entertainment
is given, every one, according to their respective
rank and consanguinity, making presents to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>the infant. In general, the children are suckled
by hired nurses, but they never are sent out
from the parents’ house. In the choice of a
nurse they are extremely particular, as she
becomes henceforward considered in the light of
relative of the family;<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c030'><sup>[36]</sup></a> she of course is never
discharged, unless at her own request. The
protection of her, and of her family, is of
the greatest consideration; and when the child
grows up, and has it in its power, he would be
deemed an unnatural being, did he neglect to
pension his nurse comfortably. Even the very
slave-girls who assisted her are always treated by
him with the utmost regard and attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘About the fourth month they allow of light
food being given to the child; on which occasion
a great entertainment is made, and repeated
when a twelvemonth old; when the <em>string</em> which
is to mark his future years, receives the first
knot. This custom seems to point out the origin
of our metaphorical <em>thread</em> of life. They never
wean the child before eighteen months sometimes
delaying it till two years and a half; on
which occasion, great presents, and new dresses,
are bestowed on the nurse, and an entertainment
is given to the friends.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Before the child is put under the direction of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>a schoolmaster, the ceremony of circumcision
takes place, which is celebrated with much
rejoicing and entertainment. One schoolmaster
generally teaches the children of two or three
neighbouring families, but the school is always
at the house of one of the parents. After
being perfected in the alphabet, the children are
taught to read, but not to understand, parts of
the Koran. Then, in succession, come the Goolestan,
Bostan, Secundar-Nameh, and some of
the Persian authors; in which language, when
the pupil is tolerably well versed, he is led on
to the study of the Arabic.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘All are obliged to be at school a considerable
time before sun-rise, that they may be present
at prayers, which are ordered to be said previous
to that period: from sun-rising to ten
o’clock they continue at their book; thence, till
dinner-time, at writing. After dinner, a short
respite is given; when prayers are again said,
and reading re-commenced: this is continued till
an hour before sun-set; when they are permitted
to separate till summoned for the evening-prayers;
after which, they repeat the day’s
lesson, and receive their final dismission. We
may reasonably conclude, that such severity of
restraint must be destructive both to mind and
body.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When arrived at the age of sixteen, or seventeen,
the parents in general provide their son
<span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>with a wife; after which, should he continue to
reside with them, his cloaths, &amp;c. are provided
for him, as if he were still in a state of pupilage:
it is only after marriage that he begins to
learn the business of his father, and the rules of
conduct necessary in the world; nay, it is often
years before he obtains permission, or the proper
means, to separate himself and his wife from
their superintendance. Should the father die
before this separation takes place, though the
son should succeed to his property, yet the
wife could have no interference in household
affairs during the life of his mother; and not
till then, could he effect any change in the interior
arrangements.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The general method of passing their time is
as follows. They arise a little before day-light.
On coming out of the <em>zenanah</em>, it may be supposed
necessary to visit the bath. Then the
morning-prayers are repeated: a slight breakfast
succeeds, consisting of fried almonds, coffee,
&amp;c.: after this, attendance at the <em>Durbar</em>,<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c030'><sup>[37]</sup></a> and
other business of the day. Returning home
about ten o’clock, all the male part of the
family assemble to partake of a more substantial
breakfast than the former. This consists of
bread, mint, onions, peas, limes, <em>kubabs</em>, <em>kullia</em>,
and <em>pillaw</em>,<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c030'><sup>[38]</sup></a> &amp;c. After passing a short while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>in conversation, a nap generally concludes the
scene; arising from which, ablution and prayers
are performed. They then assemble in the hall;
coffee &amp;c. are served up; and here they continue
to enjoy society, receiving the visits of
their friends, &amp;c., till the approach of the evening;
when the company separate.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘After prayers, if the master be a young man,
he generally retires to the <em>zenanah</em>, where, in
company with his wife, and some of his female
relations, he enjoys his <em>hookah</em>, and some trifling
refreshment of sweetmeat, &amp;c. till about
ten or eleven o’clock, when the rest of the
females retire to their own apartments. The
husband and wife always sleep on separate bed-steads,
placed adjoining to each other. From
motives of refinement and delicacy, the wife,
without an adequate motive, abstains most
rigidly from sleeping on the bed appropriated for
the husband.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Formerly, a good deal of sociability reigned
among them, and they frequently dined at each
other’s houses; but at present, the practice is
in disuse; owing to frequent acts of treachery
having been committed at such meetings: however,
sometimes, on sacred days, they still meet;
but, if of the higher orders, never without
much caution and suspicion.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘When an assembly is convened to communicate
an event of grief, the invited always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>sends the provisions to the habitation of the
inviter; who is supposed to be too much afflicted
to attend to such circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘The hour of audience at the <em>Durbar</em>, is
generally soon after sun-rising; when all those
in the employment of the great personage, attend
to make their obeisance. A few are admitted
to the presence; the rest wait the great man’s
coming out: but, should he not, they must
retire without enjoying the sun-shine of his
countenance. The modes of salutation, and the
different etiquettes, have been so frequently
detailed, that here it becomes unnecessary.
Indeed, it is not their public, but their private,
manners that we are in search of. When the
levee, or <em>Durbar</em>, is over, the great man diverts
himself with his companions, and intimate
friends, till dinner-time. Their amusement
consists, during the first part of the day, of desultory
conversation, the repetition of poems, &amp;c.,
and, towards the end, the learned men, poets,
&amp;c., are introduced to rehearse their works.
Should the evening not be devoted to the <em>zenanah</em>,
buffoons, dancing-girls, &amp;c., are summoned
to close the entertainment.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘On joyful occasions, when an entertainment
is given, the males assemble in the outer
apartments, and the females in the <em>zenanah</em>;

utmost in providing for his guests: indeed, the

mixed with acids, are offered to the guests, and
such as may be unprovided with <em>hookahs</em> are
supplied with them. After this, sugar and
water, boiled up together, forming a kind of
sherbet, is presented. Now the <em>taiffa</em>, or
dancing women, buffoons, comedians, &amp;c. exhibit
for the amusement of the company. After
the repast, various kinds of musicians are introduced,
fire-works exhibited, drums, noise, and

<p class='c008'>‘It should here be noticed, that green is the
color devoted exclusively to the mourning of a
Mussulman; thus, in the great festival of what
is commonly called ‘<span class='fss'>HOSSEIN, HOSSAN</span>,’ all
the fictitious messengers, combatants, &amp;c. are
clothed in green. Hence, we never see a Mussulman
habited in that color, nor even wearing
a green turban, unless on some funereal occasion;
from this, however, we are to except such menials,
in the services of European gentlemen, as
occasionally receive from their masters pieces of
green perpet, shalloon, &amp;c. for the purpose of
being made into <em>jammas</em>, or vests. The whole
of the Mahometan population seem to avoid the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>use of green, even in the ornaments of their carriages,
elephants’ trappings, <em>purdahs</em>, tents, &amp;c.
considering it to be, in a certain measure, sacred
to the Prophet. In this they are fastidiously
scrupulous on some occasions; I have
known a Mussulman <em>syce</em>, or groom, object to
the handle of a <em>chowry</em>, (or whisk, for keeping
flies from horses,) merely because some of the
ornaments were of that color. On one occasion,
a refractory <em>zemindar</em> reproached me with insulting
not only himself, (he being a <em>Seyed</em>, a
superior sect of Mahomedans,) but the whole
of the population, by pitching a tent, lined
with green perpet, within sight of a <em>nimauz</em>,
where the pious Mussulmans of the neighbourhood
used daily to offer up their prayers to the
Prophet. When the same hero perceived that
the furniture on a little elephant I used to ride
with a saddle, was also of that color, he affected
to be perfectly outrageous; and, in all probability,
if I had not at that time had possession both
of his person and of his means of resistance,
under charge of a company of Sepoys, would have
used his endeavors to rouse all the fanatics, of
the neighbourhood on the occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Commonly, a <em>cherauk</em>, or lamp, is kept burning
in a little niche, made in the pillar of masonry
usually erected at the head of a Mussulman’s
grave. For forty nights after the interment,
and on Thursdays especially, the nearest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>of kin frequently pass many hours in vigils over
the grave. Some confide this unpleasant duty
to a priest; who, for a few annas, performs
various ceremonies and does all in his power to
keep the deceased from troubling his surviving
relatives and friends; most of whom, at such
times, are partaking of sweetmeats, which, being
prepared on Thursdays, (<em>joomah-raut</em>,) are
called <em>joomah-raut ke metie</em>; that is to say,
‘Thursday’s confectionary.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of the native ladies, as well as the men,
but especially the Mahomedans, are very dexterous
in flying kites, called by them <em>puttungs</em>.
The construction of these varies greatly from
such as our boys use in their pastimes; they are
made more in imitation of a bird with its wings
distended, though the extremities are short and
rounded off.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to preserve that figure, they are bordered
with bamboo-wire, on which paper, of the
lightest kind, but very tough, is pasted. The
loop fastens to a very slight bamboo-rod passing
down the centre. These kites have not tails,
like ours, but are, nevertheless, easily managed
by persons accustomed from their infancy to
raising them; which they can do to an incredible
height.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lines used for this purpose are chiefly of
cotton, well twisted, thin and strong: about
forty or fifty yards of the upper end, nearest to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>the <em>puttung</em>, the cord is rubbed with a fine size,
in which levigated glass is mixed; this, when
dry, gives it something the appearance of very
fine sand paper, such as is used for cleaning
grates, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, in the great cities, thousands of
these kites are to be seen floating in the air, to
the great amusement of their respective owners;
and, indeed, of the spectators; who often take
considerable interest in the numerous contests
which are perpetually presented, by the intentional
crossing of the several cords; which, being
armed, as above described, are calculated ‘to
cut the thread of life,’ and precipitate their
several opponents.</p>

<p class='c008'>No sooner is the crossing of an adverse cord
felt, as may readily be ascertained by the vibrations
of that in hand, than a sawing motion is
given to each by the respective operators, when,
in a very little time, commonly less than a minute,
one of the kites is seen to give way. On
this sometimes considerable wagers are pending.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great art appears to be, to pass over the
adversary's cord, and then to let the kite lower
suddenly, so as to make, momentarily, an angle in
the cord thus passed over; an instantaneous pull
sometimes succeeds in severing the opponent’s
cord; it acting like a drawing cut, and presenting
a succession of points, perhaps to the length
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>of three or four yards, while the under line,
unless managed with similar activity, presents
but one point, and thus is subject to friction on
that point only; consequently must be considerably
injured.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest judgment is, however, necessary,
to determine whether, or not, the operator
presents an armed portion of his cord to an
unarmed part of that of his opponent. Should
the former be correct in this instance, he may
generally command success; but, if the reverse
be the case, he may lose the day. An unpractised
eye would be at a loss in computing the
proper distance, when the length of line let out
may perhaps exceed three or four hundred
yards; but the natives in general form a correct
estimate, and display great dexterity in avoiding
to cross any cord under unfavorable circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>This amusement generally takes place during
the cool of the evening, on the flat tops of
houses. The inhabitants of the <em>zenanah</em>, (or
<em>haram</em>,) enjoy it either from their <em>compounds</em>,
(or enclosed areas,) or on the roofs of their chambers,
on tarrasses so built up, with thin brick
walls, as to prevent their being over-looked by
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>This trait of jealousy is every where apparent:
nothing could offend a native more than
the erection of an edifice, that should afford a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>command over the interior of that enclosure in
which his family resided. An instance of this
was attended with considerable trouble and disadvantage.
The late Colonel Watson, who was
Chief Engineer under the presidency of Fort-William,
had obtained the grant of a large piece
of land, for the purpose of forming a spacious
dock for building and repairing ships.</p>

<p class='c008'>It happened, that, in enclosing the allotted
space, he overlooked the untoward circumstance
of a claim on the part of a very opulent native,
who resided close by, to a part of the circumscribed
area, which was the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>sine quâ non</em></span> of the
undertaking. The native said nothing; and, in
all probability, would have given up his land, or
at least have sold it on equitable terms, rather
than have thwarted the Colonel’s views; but,
unfortunately, the latter erected a large wind-mill,
so near to the native’s house, as to annihilate
all that privacy his family had formerly
enjoyed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The native remonstrated, but to no effect:
the grant was urged against him; and, in lieu of
soothing measures, defiance was proclaimed.
The consequence was, that the matter went
into court, when, the plantiff gaining his
cause, the wind-mill was stopped in its career,
and, with the exception of a slip, on
which some vessels have since been built, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>important, and immense, fabric, has been suffered
to fall into decay!</p>

<p class='c008'>No woman can be more jealous than those of
Hindostan: their animosity towards rivals is
unparalleled; and this, even when they do not
care a farthing for the bone of contention. Yet,
on the other hand, when more than two ladies
are retained by the same gentleman, the whole
generally become perfectly passive, at least in
exterior, appearing to associate with tolerable
cordiality. The mention of plurality, may possibly
startle many of my readers; especially
those of the fair sex; but such is common
among natives of opulence, and is not unprecedented
among Europeans. I have known
various instances of two ladies being conjointly
domesticated; and one, of an elderly military
character, who solaced himself with no less than
<span class='fss'>SIXTEEN</span>, of all sorts and sizes! Being interrogated
by a friend as to what he did with such a
number, ‘Oh!’ replied he, ‘I give them a little
rice, and let them run about!’</p>

<p class='c008'>This same gentleman, when paying his addresses
to an elegant young woman lately arrived
from Europe, but who was informed by
the lady at whose house she was residing,
of the state of affairs: the description closed
with, ‘Pray, my dear, how should you like to
share a <em>sixteenth</em> of Major ———?’ The courtship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>was allowed to proceed, merely to make
sport of the good man’s <em>foible</em>: a term peculiarly
appropriate!</p>

<p class='c008'>Nine in ten of the women domiciliated by
gentlemen, are Mussulmans; the Hindus being
far more scrupulous: with few exceptions, the
small portion not of the former sect are Portugueze.
These latter prove, in many instances,
very good house-keepers; looking after the disbursements
with great acuteness, and, on a
thousand occasions, shewing more promptness,
and more fitness for such an employment. They
are remarkably fond of rearing poultry and swine;
in which they certainly succeed. But there is a
certain something about this description of
women, which few are partial to, and which I
never could tolerate. I have already spoken of
the pride of these miserable descendants of
renowned characters; but it really is beyond
my power to describe that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>fierté</em></span>, that vindictive
spirit, that authoritative consequence, which
excite at least contempt, if not hatred, in every
person towards whom they are exercised. These
viragoes have no scruples as to what they are to
eat and drink; many of them, indeed, can manage
a bottle as well as any man in the kingdom:
they are, however, staunch Catholics, and, on
calendar days, dress out in all the finery their
kind keepers can be coaxed out of. It is not to
be supposed these ladies are more continent than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>Mussulmans, or Hindus of similar condition:
far otherwise; but they are extremely crafty,
and carefully lay the scene of action at some
place to which they resort to offer up their
prayers, in common with other equally good
Christians: by this means, they are tolerably
secure from the prying curiosity of ordinary menials,
who are not permitted to enter within the
sacred pale!</p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to the expences attendant upon concubinage
in the East, they will depend greatly
on the circumstances, and the disposition, of
the gentleman, generally speaking; though,
after a while, the lady commonly gains a kind of
ascendancy, and goes beyond those limits, which,
in almost every case, are marked out by previous
contract. A certain sum to be paid monthly;
the pay of two, or three, female attendants; an
allowance for beetle, tobacco, (it is very rarely
they <em>chew</em> it,) shoes, cloaths, and <em>gynahs</em>, (<i>i.e.</i>
gold and silver ornaments;) are articles in almost
every capitulation! Taking a broad outline,
we may put down the whole at about
forty rupees monthly; equal to sixty pounds
sterling per annum; which must certainly be
considered no great price for a bosom friend,
when compared with the sums laid out upon
<em>some</em> British damsels; who are not always more
scrupulous than those I have described. But,
when we estimate the Asiatic <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>chere amie</em></span> according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>to her merits as a companion, then, indeed,
will my fair country-women, appear most
conspicuously pre-eminent! Their agreeable
manners, their polished language, their highly
cultivated minds, and their pleasing attentions,
are so irresistible, as to level the barriers of discretion,
and to render every attempt at comparison
nugatory; indeed, incompatible!</p>

<p class='c008'>In taking the above average, viz. forty rupees
per month, I have supposed the gentleman to
be in easy circumstances; otherwise, that sum
will be found to exceed the proportion of his
other expences considerably: at the lowest, we
cannot estimate the charges at less than twenty-five
rupees monthly; which, to say the truth,
must be attended with several deficiencies, or
privations, by no means creditable. In this particular,
the natives are very scrupulous, and
hold it the highest disgrace, for a woman to be
retained, without due attendance, suitable
cloathing, and a participation of the comforts, if
not of the luxuries, of life. The men, especially
the Hindus, are indifferent in regard to
their own apparel; which is often mean to an
extreme; but pride themselves on the splendor,
and profusion, to be found in their <em>zenanahs</em>.
As an instance in point, I must state, that, in
the year 1784, a detachment of six companies
was sent out from Cawnpore, on the road to
Etayah, in compliment to the <em>B’how-Buxey</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>a General of some note in the Maharrattah army,
who was proceeding on an embassy to Lucknow.
We met him about twenty miles to the
Westward of the cantonments; where we were
nearly smothered by the dust raised by his immense
retinue, and absolutely stunned by the
unmerciful clangor of cracked trumpets, and of
great bells suspended from the sides of elephants,
whose motion caused the pendulous monotonists
to ring ‘a sonorous peal’. It was natural to
expect that the <em>B’how</em>, who knew we were
waiting to receive him, and, that an officer of
rank was deputed on the occasion, would have
exhibited himself to advantage; but, to our
great surprize, when he alighted from his elephant,
which was sumptuously caparisoned, he
appeared the veriest <em>bunyah</em>, (or petty shop-keeper,)
my eyes had ever beheld! His cloaths
were absolutely filthy, and of a fabric such as
disgraced the wearer. None of our <em>khedmutgars</em>
could have changed apparel with him, without
being considerable losers by the bargain. The
<em>B’how</em> was, nevertheless, attended by a <em>nautch-tuffah</em>,
or set of dancing-girls; whose equipage
announced his liberality, and whose talents
evinced his judgement. Let me not be misunderstood
in this last expression: the dancers
of India can suit only particular tastes, and those
perhaps only from habit: they are not to be
classed with persons of the same profession in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>Europe; but are a distinct genus. It cannot,
however, be denied, that some among them possess
very superior powers in the vocal part of
their profession; and that certain individuals
dance, in their style, with peculiar effect; indeed,
with much graceful delicacy, and with
undeviating regard to the measure. The <em>B’how’s
zenanah</em> was of course secluded; but the number
of the elephants, <em>r’huts</em>, <em>palanquins</em>, <em>doolies</em>
and other conveyances, satisfied me that the
ladies were in better plight than their most
abominably filthy lord!</p>

<p class='c008'>The Hindostanee ladies do not wear shoes,
but when walking, a pair of slippers are put on
for the occasion; so soon as the lady returns to
her seat on the <em>satrinje</em>, or carpet, they are
thrown aside. Such as are formed without
heels, and have the back part made to flatten
down under the foot, for that part is seldom, if
ever, raised, are known by the name of <em>k’hous</em>;
while those made without any back-piece, the
quarters terminating under the ancles on each
side, and that have raised heels, to perhaps the
height of an inch, are designated <em>chinauls</em>. In
either kind, as well as in the <em>jooties</em> worn by
men, the toe-part is terminated by a long pointed
strip, usually of leather lined with cloth, that
curls inwards over the toes; without this, the
shoes would be considered both unfinished, and
vulgar. Men commonly wear only embroidered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>shoes, but the women have frequently an abundance
of various colored foils, principally purple
or green, fastened down to the body of the
vamp, (which is of some bright colored broad
cloth,) and serving, by the manner in which they
are disposed, to fill up the pattern of the embroidery:
this may be either of gold or silver
thread, or, perhaps, very small bugles, not dissimilar
to seed-pearls. Those who cannot afford
such decorations, which may raise the price of
a pair of shoes to about four or five rupees;
content themselves with silken ornaments. The
low price of a pair of shoes ornamented as above
described, cannot fail to strike the reader, who
will be yet more astonished to learn, that an admirably
well-dressed hide may be had in any part
of the country for less than five shillings; such
as would sell with us for about thirty shillings,
or even more. Those stout shoes worn by our
native soldiery, rarely cost more than from four
to eight annas the pair, (equal to from eight to
sixteen pence.) Neither men nor women use
stockings; though, during the winter months,
the more opulent sometimes wear a short kind of
sock, called a <em>jooraub</em>, made of cotton, or of
silk, perhaps both intermixed, and of various
colored patterns. These are remarkably thick,
but rarely reach above the ancle. Persons of
the first rank, have their <em>jooraubs</em>, as also their
<em>dustannahs</em>, or gloves, made of shawl; strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>to say, these are usually of the form in use
among us for children; that is, they have a
receptacle for the thumb, but the fingers are all
contained in the same bag, or <em>cyst</em>. It is, however,
very uncommon to see a woman, of whatever
rank, wear gloves: this is, no doubt,
owing to the pride they take in their hands,
which are invariably ornamented with gold or
silver rings, &amp;c., to the utmost extent of their
purses. In fact, the whole attention of a
Hindostanee woman, retained in the family of
an European, is directed towards the accumulation
of trinkets, which may be supposed to be
tolerably expensive, when it is understood that
nothing less than solid silver is admissible. Gilt,
or plated, ornaments, are held to be disreputable,
and unlucky; hence, the <em>moolumbah</em>, or plating
trade, is very little followed in India; though
the jewellers will sometimes pass off a coated,
for a solid article; especially in gold work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following are the ornaments chiefly worn
by the Hindostanee ladies. The <em>maung-teekah</em>,
meaning the frontal, ornament, has usually a
star, or radiated centre, of about two inches in
diameter, set in gold, and richly ornamented
with small pearls, of which, various chains are
attached, aiding to support it in its position;
namely, on the centre of the forehead. A
triple, or quadruple, row of pearls, passes up
the centre of the <em>maung</em>, or front; the hair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>being divided, and kept down very flat. The
centre piece, (and, occasionally, each end piece
also,) is composed of precious stones, such as
the topaz, the emerald, the amethyst, the ruby,
&amp;c.: sometimes the centre is of one color, and
all the rays of some other; or perhaps the latter
are alternate. The <em>maung-teekah</em>, as may be
judged from the above description, is not a very
light ornament, but is extremely splendid, and,
being generally set in gold, often very valuable:
one of a very ordinary description will cost full
twelve or fifteen guineas, though composed of
colored glass, or chrystal, or foils: when made
of precious stones, the price may reach to any
extent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>kurrum-phool</em>, is not unlike the centre
piece of a <em>maung-teekah</em>, and may be about the
same size, though usually somewhat less in
diameter. This ornament is fastened to the
lobe of the ear, both by the usual mode of
piercing, and by a chain of gold passing over the
ear, so as to bear the weight of the <em>kurrum-phool</em>;
which would else cause the lobe to be greatly
extended downward. It is, however, to be
remarked, that most of the common women
have large holes in that part of the ear, wide
enough to pass a finger through; and that even
the higher orders consider an aperture such as
would admit a pea, rather honorable, than
otherwise; under the opinion of its indicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>the great weight, and consequent value, of their
jewels.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>joomkah</em> is ever of solid gold, silver being
in this absolutely interdicted by the laws of
taste; in framing which, pride seems to have
had no very small share. This ornament consists
of a hollow hemisphere, or bell, curiously fillagreed,
and about three fourths of an inch in
diameter; the edges suspend small rods, or pendants
of gold, each furnished with one or more
small pearls, garnets, &amp;c.; perhaps to the number
of a dozen pendants being attached to the
circumference of each <em>joomkah</em>. The upper
part is furnished with a small perforated stud,
sometimes ornamented, through which a ring,
about the thickness of a fine knitting-needle,
and not less than half an inch in diameter, is inserted;
it previously passing through the ear
in the part usually pierced. This ring, as well
as every other kind of fastening made to pass
through the ears, or nose, is made of the purest
gold, and so pliant as to allow the little hook
made at one end, by bending the wire, for the
purpose of fixing into a minute loop, or eye,
formed, at the other end, by twisting it, to be
straightened, at pleasure, by means of the nail
only.</p>

<p class='c008'>European ladies content themselves with one
appendage at each ear; while the females of
Hindostan think it impossible to have too many:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>thus, they affix a number of small rings, of pure
gold, or, in case of poverty, of silver, or even of
tin, all along the border of the ear; which is
pierced for that purpose in at least a dozen places,
to receive these ornaments, from which much
distress often arises, owing to the veil (already
described) frequently hitching upon the small
hooked ends of the wire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The nose has its share in the decorations of
the Hindostanee fair, it usually bearing two ornaments;
one, called a <em>n’hut</em>, commonly passed
through the left nostril, consists only of a piece
of gold wire, as thick as a small knitting-needle,
with the usual hook and eye, and having the
centre, or nearly so, furnished with several garnets,
pearls, &amp;c. perhaps to the number of five
or six, each parted from its neighbour by a
thin plate of gold, usually having serrated, or
escaloped edges, and being fixed transversely
upon the wire, which passes through their centres,
as well as through the garnets, pearls,
&amp;c. The diameter of the circle of a <em>n’hut</em>
may be, ordinarily, about two inches and a half.
On the coast of Coromandel, a similar ornament
is worn by men of respectability, in each ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The other nasal trinket is called a <em>bolauk</em>; it
is flat, something in the form of that article of
furniture called a footman, and has a small ring,
with hook and eye, at its narrowest part, for
the purpose of appending it to the middle of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>nose, by means of a gold ring passing through
the <em>septum</em>, or division between the nostrils;
the ornament lying flat upon the upper lip, and
having its broad end furnished with pendants,
similar to those on a <em>joomkah</em>. It is inconceivable
what some women undergo for the sake of
displaying their riches in this way! Not only
does the <em>bolauk</em> interfere with the operations of
the lips during meals, but sores of the most unsightly
description are often created, in that
very tender part to which the ornament attaches,
by those innumerable accidents, which not even
the most constant vigilance can prevent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The neck is not forgotten among those lavish
decorations of which the sable ladies are so
fond; it is furnished with various kinds of necklace,
of which I shall describe only the <em>chumpauk-gully</em>.
This is made of separate rays, each
intended to represent a petal of the <em>chumpauk</em>,
(a flower indigenous throughout Asia,) and having
a fixed ring, or staple, at its butt, so that
the whole may be strung close together, perhaps
to the number of forty pieces, or more. This
ornament is usually worn rather loose, that it
may reach half way down the bosom. The
mounting is gold, or silver, according to the
means of the wearer; and the rays, or petals,
are, in imitation of the <em>maung-teekah</em>; either
chrystals, set on foils, chiefly white; or they are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>precious stones, of one color, throughout the
ornament.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <em>haunseah</em> is a solid collar of gold, or
silver, weighing from perhaps, four ounces to
near a pound. I have seen several that approached
the latter weight, and must have been
highly oppressive to the wearer; especially as
they only came into use on high days and holidays:
the general standard may be computed at
about six or seven ounces. Being made of pure
metal, they are easily bent, so as to be put on
and off. <em>Haunseahs</em> are commonly square in
front, under the chin, for several inches, and
taper off gradually to not more than half their
greatest diameter; terminating at each end with
a small knob, cut into a polygonal form: this
ornament is sometimes carved in the Oriental
style, either for its whole length, or on the front
part only.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the Hindostanee women wear <em>tabeejes</em>,
strung upon an assemblage of black silk threads,
passing round their necks, and reaching to their
middles: these <em>tabeejes</em> are silver cases, enclosing
either quotations from the Koran, or some
mystical writings, or some rubbish from the
animal or vegetable kingdom, but, I believe,
never any <em>camphor</em> (as lately used by a celebrated
English lady). Whatever the contents
may be, great reliance is placed on their efficacy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>in repelling disease, and in averting the influence
of witch-craft, (<em>j’haddoo</em>,) of which the
people of India, of every sect, entertain the most
unlimited dread. Hence, it is not uncommon
to see half a dozen, or more, of these charms
strung upon the same threads.</p>

<p class='c008'>The upper parts of the arms are adorned with
semi-circular ornaments, made hollow, but filled
up with melted rosin; the ends are furnished
with loops of the same metal, generally silver,
which admit silken skeans, whereby they are
secured to their places. The above trinket is
called a <em>baujoo-bund</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wrists are always profusely decorated:
the more ordinary classes wear rings made of
<em>kaunch</em>, or <em>chank</em>; (<i>i.e.</i> the common <a id='corr425.16'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sea-conch,'>sea-conch,)</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_425.16'><ins class='correction' title='sea-conch,'>sea-conch,)</ins></a></span>
cut out, by means of very fine saws, into narrow
slips which, when joined very accurately, give
the whole an appearance of being formed from
the most circular part of each shell. This is,
indeed, sometimes done; but such entire rings
are very scarce, and are usually preserved in
their original pure whiteness with much assiduity.
The city of Dacca, so famous for its
muslins, carries on a large intercourse with Chittagong,
and the coast of Aracan, for conchs,
which are used for beetling the finer cloths, manufactured
in that populous and rich emporium
of cotton fabrics. The noise made by <em>chanking</em>
the cloths, which, being laid many folds thick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>upon a large board, are beat with <em>conchs</em>, wherein
handles are inserted, is peculiarly distressing to
an unaccustomed ear; especially as the operation
continues night and day, without intermission:
to those interested in the trade, it may
perhaps be highly agreeable! The small process,
or button, at the base of each shell, is sawn off,
and, after being ground to a shape resembling
that of a flat turnip, is perforated, for the purpose
of being strung. When so prepared, these
receive the name of <em>kuntahs</em>; of which, two rows,
each containing from thirty to forty, are worn
round the neck of every Sepoy in the Company’s
service, as a part of his uniform. This simple
ornament affords a pleasant relief to the sable
countenance of a native, and serves to fill up a
space, that would otherwise appear extremely
naked, between the collar-bones and the chin.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rings made from the sea-conch, are called
<em>kaunch ke t’choory</em>, or <em>t’choories</em> made of conch;
in contra-distinction to a common kind of <em>t’choories</em>,
made, by persons who follow that profession
only, from a species of silicious clay, which
speedily vitrifies, forming a semi-transparent
mass, that is worked into rings of about a line
in diameter; but having rather quadrangular
than circular surfaces; so that the inner circumference
may be rather easy to the wrist, and the
upper part, (or outer circumference,) be sufficiently
flat to exhibit various embellishments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>given by aid of gold leaf, and little enamelled,
or lacquered specks, &amp;c., applied thereto, and
afterwards burnt in. It is inconceivable how
expert the women who vend the <em>t’choories</em>, and
who are thence called <em>t’chooríaens</em>, are in applying
these ornaments; which, after being once passed
over the hand, often are found to fit the wrist
admirably: persons unacquainted with the dexterity
of these women, would, on seeing the
rings before they were on, consider it impossible
to get the hand through; yet, by means of a
little oil, or even of water, and compressing the
very flexible member into a suitable form, the
rings are successively made to glide over the
joints with tolerable facility; very few, in proportion,
being broken during the operation. It
is to be remarked, that, as probably forty or fifty
<em>t’choories</em> are to be worn upon each wrist, those
appropriated to the thicker part of the arm,
being, of course, the first to pass, the hand
becomes gradually suppled, and disposed to receive
each succeeding ring, which is imperceptibly of
less diameter than its predecessor. To say the
most of <em>t’choories</em>, they have a very heavy
appearance, and are always highly uncomfortable
to Madam’s most intimate acquaintances, in consequence
of their being peculiarly brittle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some ladies wear a massy ring of solid silver
on each wrist, weighing, perhaps, from three to
five ounces: these are commonly hexagonal, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>octagonal, of an equal thickness throughout,
and terminated by a knob at each end, the same
as in the <em>haunseah</em>. Being of pure silver, this
ornament, which is called a <em>kurrah</em>, may be
opened sufficiently to be put on, or off, at pleasure;
the ends being brought together by an easy
pressure of the other hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bracelet, formed of small pointed prisms of
solid silver, each about the size of a very large
barley-corn, and having a ring soldered to one of
its sides is in very common use. These prisms
are strung upon black silk, as close as their
pointed, or perhaps rounded, ends will admit,
in three or four parallel rows, and then fastened,
the same as the <em>baujoo-bund</em>. Some of the bracelets,
which bear the general name of <em>poanҫhies</em>,
are of gold, intermixed with pearls; affording a
very rich appearance: they are certainly more
ornamental than <em>t’choories</em>, which are, in the
end, very expensive, on account of the immense
numbers that give way in the wearing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thumb of each hand is generally destined
to bear an ornament called <em>inah</em>, (or looking-glass,)
formed of a ring fitting upon the thumb,
and having a small mirror, about the size of a
half-penny, fixed upon it by the centre, so as to
accord with the back of the thumb. Each finger
is provided with its quota of <em>angooties</em>, or rings,
of various sorts and sizes, generally of gold;
those of silver being considered mean. The <em>inah</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>should correspond in this particular; but, on
account of the quantity of gold required wherein
to set the glass, many content themselves with
silver mounting. That a small looking-glass
may, at times, be commodiously situated at the
back of the thumb, we will not dispute; but
what shall we say to that preposterous custom,
which I have absolutely witnessed, of wearing a
similar ornament on each great toe!!!</p>

<p class='c008'>A lady, at all priding herself on the splendor
of her dress, must have a pair of very substantial
<em>kurrahs</em>, or rings of silver, not weighing less
than half a pound each, upon her ancles. She
must also have a pair of <em>paum-jebs</em>, made flexible,
and ornamented with little spherical bells,
all of which tinkle at every motion of the limb.
The ordinary pattern of the <em>paum-jeb</em>, is mural,
each piece being kept in its place by wires,
passing through its two ends vertically. The
toes have likewise their rings, called <em>chellahs</em>,
usually of about the fifth of an inch in breadth
and very thin; these have, for the most part,
beaded edges.</p>

<p class='c008'>The women of Portugueze extraction, wear
their hair in a large top knot, secured by an
immense silver pin, or rather a skewer; the
broad part of which is either fillagreed, enamelled,
or engraved. The Hindostanee ladies
wear no ornament of that description; they
comb down their frontal hair, while abundantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>moistened with <em>tissy</em>, that is, the mucilage obtained
by steeping linseed in a small quantity of
water; and causing it to part from the centre in
two diverging sweeps, or crescents, that come
down to the exterior corners of the eye-brows,
falling in immediately above the ears, they thus
render the whole smooth, compact, and glossy.
All the hair appertaining to the hinder part of
the head, is braided together for its whole
length, and ultimately blended with black ribbon;
which continues the braid for many inches,
or even for a foot or more, so as to render it doubtful,
at a certain distance, whether the hair does
not occupy the whole length. This is a point of
the utmost importance with a native lady, who
values her locks beyond even her virtue. Whether
it were the cause, or the effect, is difficult
to say; but certain it is, that, one of the greatest
punishments a judge can inflict on a woman, is
to have her head shaved. Query, Did their
high estimation of the hair, induce to making
its privation a punishment? or, did that estimation
take place, in consequence of the want of
hair being considered disgraceful? I am inclined
to favor the first opinion. It is very
common for a native to cause the hair of his
<em>baundy</em>, or female slave, to be taken off, for
any trifling offence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Coral beads are in high estimation throughout
Hindostan, as applicable to the construction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>of necklaces and bracelets for women. Notwithstanding
they are manufactured from the red
coral, fished up in various parts of Asia, these
beads are very costly, especially when they run to
any size. They are generally sold by the sicca-weight,
or <em>tolah</em>; that is, by their weight in silver,
two and a half rupees weighing about one ounce;
or eighty to the seer of nearly two pounds
avoirdupoise. A <em>tolah</em> of high colored, sound
beads, as large as a marrow-fat pea, may commonly
be had for about three, or four, rupees;
sometimes cheaper: consequently, an ounce of
coral beads, called <em>moongahs</em>, will cost near a
guinea. This, which is four times the value of
silver, appears to be a high price, considering
the low wages of laborers, and proves that coral
cannot be advantageously imported from India
to England. The ladies of Asia are very particular
in often steeping their <em>moongahs</em> in pigeon’s
blood; under the firm belief of their color being
heightened by such immersions! This recipe
may, however, be matched by many, of equal
efficacy, highly valued among ourselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lowest, and most poverty-struck woman
in Bengal, would consider herself truly wretched
if she could not, now and then, anoint her
head with oil, of some kind. The ladies of
affluence invariably use scented oils, of which
those impregnated with the bale, the jasmine,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>and sandal, are most in use. Doubtless, custom
reconciles ‘the rancid fragrance’ to the
nostrils of an Asiatic; but, to an European, nothing
can be more offensive. A full dressed
Hindostanee lady is the living type of that sarcastic
couplet of Swift.</p>

</div>

<p class='c029'>The sale of these oils, as also of the <em>missy</em>,
which is applied by both sexes to their teeth,
and, by forming a black coating, or varnish, is
supposed to preserve their enamel from the
action of the lime contained in the <em>pawn</em>, or
beetle, they generally chew, as also of the <em>soormah</em>,
or levigated antimony, used for blackening
the edges of the eye-lids, together with a variety
of rubbish, is confined to a class of men called
<em>gundies</em>, who carry their ware about in small
baskets. The oils, and especially the <em>utr</em>, or
<em>ottah</em> of roses, are very carefully packed in
cotton-wool, and every pretence is made of
their being of great value. It is wonderful
what deceptions this class of hawkers practise!
They are most consummate in the arts
of flattery and intrigue; from the exercise of
one or the other, not unfrequently of both conjoined,
they could not fail to become very rich,
did they not generally lead most dissipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>lives, and often take payment <em>in kind</em> for their
wares.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to the perfumed oils in common
use among the Hindostanee ladies, their preparation
is very easy; being, for the most part,
merely sweet oils of any kind; such as that
extracted from linseed, or from the cocoa-nut,
or from any plant coming under the denomination
of <em>metah</em>, (<i>i.e.</i> sweet,) perfumed by
means of a small quantity of the essential oil of
any fragrant flower, particularly the rose, the
jasmine, the bale, &amp;c. All these oils are extremely
common, rarely selling for more than
two or three rupees per seer; which corresponds
with about seven shillings for an English quart.</p>

<p class='c008'>That highly fragrant oil extracted from the
rose, called <em>attar</em>, or by us <em>ottah</em>, is by no means
so common as might be expected, at least not in
perfection: as to reputed <em>attar</em>, that may be had
of every <em>gundy</em>, and at even a few annas per
<em>tolah</em> (or half ounce weight). Genuine <em>attar</em> can
only be had of particular persons, and then at a
very high price; commonly about four guineas,
(<i>i.e.</i> two gold mohurs) per ounce. The natives,
for many years, pretended to make a great
secret of the process whereby this valuable oil
was extracted; whence they not only retained
the whole profit to themselves, but were enabled
to practise various deceptions of great advantage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>to themselves but extremely injurious
to the extract.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although many gentlemen had occasionally
endeavored to ascertain the proportions used by
the venders of <em>attar</em>, it was not until about the
year 1781, or 1782, that any attempt was made,
on an extensive scale, to competite with that
class of distillers. The late Lieutenant-Colonel
Anthony Polier, who resided for many years at
his beautiful villa, some miles from Lucknow,
was, I believe, the first whose researches included
the distillation of <em>attar</em>, in which pursuit
he was remarkably successful; considering
how much intrigue, corruption, and ignorance
he had to contend with, I have heard that gentleman
declare, that, in almost every train of
experiments he undertook, some latent opposition
was sure to prevail; often baffling every
effort, and sometimes compelling him to abandon
his design.</p>

<p class='c008'>This resulted from the jealousy entertained
by the natives of distinction at the court of the
Nabob Vizier of Oude, <span class='sc'>Azoph ul Dowlah</span>,
with whom his extreme urbanity, suavity of
manners, ingenuity, and incorruptible integrity,
rendered him a great favorite. The courtiers
apprehended, that, through the united intelligence
of Colonel Polier, and of Colonel Claude
Martine, whose genius in every mechanical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>art was on a par with that of the former in
the polite arts, as well as in most branches of
useful science, the several expensive establishments
supported by the Nabob would ultimately
be set aside, as useless, and as devouring a revenue,
which might be turned towards purposes
in which they should have no concern; or, at
least, no profit. Therefore, notwithstanding
his highness’s positive orders, most of the indispensables
were either withheld, or, when furnished
at all, proved of the worst quality: any
man less mild than Polier, would have insisted
on a due attention to his requisitions; but he
forbore from remonstrance, except when so
closely pressed as to render representation inevitable.
Whenever, in spite of all direct hostility,
and of underhand resistance, the Colonel fulfilled
his wishes, displaying the complete success of
his ingenuity and learning; then, all was cried
down as <em>j’haddoo</em>, as witch-craft; and the whole
body of Mahomedan ecclesiastics joined to crush
the growth of science.</p>

<p class='c008'>Being provided with an ample still, and having
very extensive plantations of roses, in which I
have often passed a leisure hour, admiring equally
their fragrance, and the amiable qualities of
their planter, the Colonel made a shift to carry
on his operations, but not with invariable success;
the native distillers having frequently
influenced his servants, by means of bribes, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>mix various ingredients, which either tainted, or
otherwise deteriorated, the produce of his still.
At length, after a great variety of experiments,
in which he, of course, experienced many most
mortifying, and equally unaccountable disappointments,
he hit upon the just proportions,
and the most favorable process. His method
was as follows. To a maund (<i>i.e.</i> 82lb.) of
roses, he put about a maund and a half of water:
the roses being entire, and having their stems
cut away close under the chalices. These being
all duly mixed, by hand, in the still, a gentle
fire was made under it; the head not being applied
until the water began to throw off a vapor:
after that, it was put on, and carefully luted
down. The fire was, throughout the distillation,
kept rather slow than fierce; especially
after about a tenth part of the water had come
over into the receiver: in about five hours, half
the water had come over tolerably clear. The
rose-water thus obtained, was again put to another
maund of roses, which were subjected to
the same operation, until about half its quantity
had passed into the receiver. As the former was
called ‘single rose-water,’ so was this designated
‘double rose-water;’ but it is evident that the
term ‘quadruple’ would be more appropriate,
since <em>double the quantity of perfume was brought
into half the former space</em>. The produce of the
last distillation was put into broad pans, either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>of earthen ware, or of tinned metal, and left
exposed, during the night, to the cold air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Here, I should remark, that the roses generally
bloom early in the year, and that, during
the month of January, sometimes, also, in February,
ice is produced by pouring hot water
into shallow pans of porous crockery; which,
being placed on beds of loose sand, in exposed
situations, during the whole night, generally
yield a substantial pellicle, and, in very favorable
instances, sometimes cause the whole of
the water to be congealed. The colonel’s object,
in exposing the rose-water, as above shewn,
was to congeal the essential oil, called <em>attar</em>,
which has the peculiar property of becoming
compact, and flaky, when exposed to a degree
of cold far above freezing point; in this instance,
bearing some affinity to animal oils in general.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, it is evident, that such an exposure
subjected the <em>attar</em>, which floated on the surface
as it became cold, to the access of dust, at
least, if not of other grosser rubbish; therefore
the plan was certainly injudicious: this the
colonel soon perceived, for the quantity of,
what he considered to be, <em>fæces</em>, proved that
there was some mismanagement. Accordingly,
he took a hint, and, while the rose-water was
yet lukewarm, poured it into a large <em>caraboy</em>, or
glass bottle; so as to fill it completely. The
<em>caraboy</em> was then subjected to a refrigerating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>process; by which the <em>attar</em> was condensed on
its surface in its neck, whence it was easily
removed into a large-mouthed phial, furnished
with a ground stopper. What little adhered to
the neck of the <em>caraboy</em>, did not come away
with the rose-water, as it was poured off, but,
on the vessel being reversed, and subjected to
a considerable degree of heat, dropped slowly
into a phial placed below it, but protected from
the action of the fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The products in <em>attar</em> have been widely different.
The natives rarely obtain more than a
drachm and a half from a maund of roses;
whereas Colonel Polier obtained full two
drachms from a hundred pounds troy. In Europe,
we find that some continental chymists
have extracted half an ounce: Hamberg succeeded
so far as to draw a whole ounce, and
Hoffman was rewarded with no less than two
ounces. All these persons, however, rejected
the chalices; using only the petals; which
necessarily made a great difference, the perfume
being, principally, if not wholly, confined to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rose-water, even after the <em>attar</em> has been
completely separated, is rich in fragrance, but is
far more so, when the <em>attar</em> is suffered to remain
united with it, as may be effected by the addition
of various <em>menstrua</em>, which keep it suspended
in the fluid. The general price of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>rose-water as is ordinarily sold under the designation
of ‘double,’ and, of course, passes for
the very best, may be from twenty, to forty,
rupees per maund, according as the season may
have been productive, or as the purchase may
be made from the distiller himself, or through
a second or a third hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colonel Polier states that the quantity of <em>attar</em>
obtained from nearly fifty-five maunds of roses,
which grew upon about eleven acres of good
soil, highly manured, amounted to sixteen <em>tolahs</em>,
or about half a pound avoirdupoise. This
gives us some insight into the value of the <em>attar</em>;
for, if we allow the land to have been worth a
guinea per acre, and that the cultivation, together
with the expences of distillation, should
amount to as much more, the following would
be the state of the concern.</p>

<p class='c029'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>In the above, I have taken the <em>attar</em> at far less
than the price it at present bears, and the rose-water
at the rate usually charged at Juanpore,
Lucknow, &amp;c. for a maund of the best rose-water,
at the time Colonel Polier’s experiment,
above detailed, was dated, namely, in 1787. If
my information is correct, the best <em>attar</em> now
sells at Calcutta for near six guineas the ounce;
and the best rose-water at Juanpore, where a
large quantity is distilled, for thirty-five and
forty rupees per maund. The expence of the
cultivation is taken at about seven rupees
monthly, on an average; there being no work of
consequence performed, except hoeing, for full
eight months in the year. The rent of the land
is rated at the ordinary medium at which I compute
soils suited to the growth of tobacco, cotton,
sugar, opium, &amp;c. to be of late, that is, at
about 2½ rupees, or eight shillings per <em>bigah</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In Doctor Willich’s Encyclopædia, I observe
it is stated, that genuine <em>attar</em> sells, even in the
East Indies, at twenty guineas the ounce; but
I apprehend this to be a great error; at least, it
is far beyond what the experience of more than
twenty years allows me to credit. If, indeed,
the Doctor means that which the <em>gundies</em> retail,
by mixing only <em>one drop</em> of genuine <em>attar</em> among
pint of oil of sandal-wood, as is often practised,
he is far short of the mark; for, in such case,
the ounce may be said to sell for nearer fifty,
than twenty guineas.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>The color of <em>attar</em>, is remarked by Colonel
Polier, ‘to be no criterion of its goodness,
its quality, or its country.’ That gentleman
states, that he had, in the same year, and from
the same rose-bushes, <em>attar</em> of a fine emerald
green, of a bright yellow, and of a reddish hue,
all obtained by the same process, only that the
roses were collected on different <a id='corr441.8'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='days.’'>days.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_441.8'><ins class='correction' title='days.’'>days.</ins></a></span></p>

<p class='c008'>Here I am disposed to suspect, that the old
trick, so peremptorily detected by Doctor and
Professor Gilchrist, of mixing a solution of verdigris,
or other coloring matter, in the still, or
in the receiver, must have been practised by
some of the Colonel’s attendants. It has been
sufficiently proved, that, when no such adulteration
takes place, <em>attar</em> very nearly limpid:
but, though a color may be thus imparted, it
does not appear that the perfume is debased; its
fragrance being unimpaired: on the other hand,
the admixture of any other oil is readily discovered,
by its causing the disposition to liquescence,
even when exposed to severe cold, which
distinguishes every other known perfume from
genuine <em>attar</em>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some ladies anoint their bodies with scented
oils, but, for the most part, a predilection exists
in favor of that extracted from the <em>sesamum</em>,
or mustard seed; which is likewise in very
general use throughout every branch of culinary
preparation, among the natives of every sect.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>When the oil is applied to the body, (over every
part of which it is smeared, the gratified individual
generally exposing himself to the influence
of the sun while the unction is performing,) it
is in its raw state; but when intended for sauce,
it is, on account of the peculiar rankness of its
flavor, subjected to the following simple operation,
whereby it is very considerably sweetened;
though not divested of a certain flavor by which
its presence may always be detected. The oil
is put into a deep vessel, either earthen or of
metal, having some kind of lid, such as a flat
pan, &amp;c. to retain the heat while the oil is preparing:
when it boils, and crackles, one side of
the lid is lifted, and a small quantity of cold
water thrown in, the lid being shut down as
quickly as possible, lest the oil, which flies immediately
when touched by the water, should
scald the operator. This is repeated three or
four times, at short intervals, and the oil is
thus nearly divested of its unpleasant and
acrimonious flavor. Both sexes anoint their
bodies with the oil of <em>sesamum</em>, commonly called
by Europeans ‘<em>mosaul</em> oil,’ from its being invariably
used by the <em>mosaulchies</em> to feed the flames
of their links, or <em>mosauls</em>: by the natives it is
designated <em>kurwah-tale</em>, or ‘bitter oil.’ In some
instances, we see turmeric mixed with it, for
the purpose of excitement to perspiration! this
absurd practice is not very general, but one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>would suppose the fallacy of such an opinion
must long ago have been discovered, and that
the turmeric would have been found rather to
add to that obstruction, inevitably created by
the oil, than to promote diaphoresis. The only
intention that seems truly to be answered by
the unction, is that of <em>stopping</em> the pores:
hence, we see all the poor people, throughout
India, avail themselves, whenever the means
offer, of a handful or two of <em>kurwah-tale</em>, to rub
over their skins, during the winter season especially;
thereby to resist the cold air: many, who
can afford but a light kind of cloathing, and are
not competent to purchase quilted jackets,
would be almost frozen, were it not for this
device.</p>

<p class='c008'>This practice, so extremely common, I might
say, universal, throughout India, seems to be at
variance with the opinions of our physicians,
who consider it highly dangerous to close too
many of the pores at one time. That it is done
with impunity in India, is too well known to
require any evidence being here adduced: nay,
more, such unctions are recommended in high
fevers, by the native doctors, (generally Bramins,)
who likewise prescribe a thick plaistering
of pounded herbs to be in such cases applied all
over the body. This, which rarely fails to produce
relief, is evidently the basis of that refrigerant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>course adopted, of late years, by some of
our most celebrated medical characters.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a perfume, the more delicate ladies of
India rub themselves with various drugs, not
very gratifying to the olfactory nerves of our
Europeans; the same is also used for the hair.
A few use a kind of pomade, made extemporaneously
of orange peels, ground fine upon
a stone, and mixed with flour, made from peas,
called <em>basin</em>. This is really fragrant, as well
as cleansing; but I cannot so much admire the
sandal some substitute for the <em>citric aroma</em>; it
being of a peculiarly sickly scent, which does
not easily wash out of linen.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to religious ablutions, the natures
of every sect, but especially the Bramins,
are very particular; even fastidiously so: all
bathe at least once daily before their dinner
hour, whatever may be the state of the weather,
repairing either to some neighbouring river, or
to a pond, (or <em>tank</em>,) for that purpose. There
they walk up to their waists in the water; and,
placing their thumbs in their ears, and their
fore-fingers pressing their nostrils, immerse themselves,
by squatting suddenly upon their haunches,
several times in succession; generally repeating
various prayers on these occasions. All take
this opportunity to wash their <em>doties</em>, and other
parts of their apparel; having in readiness dry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>cloaths to put on, but which are, of course, left
upon the shore. It is curious to see, as may
often be done at some <em>ghauts</em>, or wharfs, hundreds
of persons bathing in this manner at the
same time; the water is often thronged for the
whole day; especially at Benares, Allahabad,
Betoor, and other sacred cities, to which pilgrims
resort from immense distances for that purpose.
At particular times, it is supposed that nearly
a million of persons assemble to bathe in the
Ganges; whence it must appear extremely curious
to the European reader, that scarce an instance
is known of any person losing his cloaths
while bathing: perhaps it may be in some measure
owing to that astonishing concourse of barbers,
who officíate previous to each person entering
the sacred stream; and who usually take
charge of, or at least have an eye to, the vestments
left for his use on returning from the
water.</p>

<p class='c008'>At all the bathing-places the sexes intermix
promiscuously; each being in their usual cloathing:
this does not, however, relate to women
of a superior class, who are not suffered to go
abroad except in close vehicles, and who, were
they voluntarily to shew their faces to any male,
except their husbands, would be in danger of
losing their heads: such never bathe in the
river but under ample precautions. A spot is
selected, where the water shoals gradually, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>where the bather cannot be overlooked from any
height, &amp;c. There, an area is enclosed, by means
of <em>kanauts</em>, supported to the height of perhaps
eight feet, or more, by means of bamboo poles,
kept in their places by ropes fastened to stakes,
or to poles driven into the sand. The lady is
carried to an overlap, or opening, in the <em>kanauts</em>,
mostly in a covered carriage, of which the
driver retires, taking with him the oxen, and
leaving the machine enclosed within the area,
where it serves the purpose of a dressing-room.
The female servants attend the interior, while
the exterior is guarded by centinels, or perhaps
by eunuchs, on the land side; and, towards any
navigable channel a boat is stationed, to prevent
the approach of strangers. But few Mahomedan
women bathe in this manner; they, as
well as their husbands, generally content themselves
with having five or six large pots of water
thrown over their heads; the generality of Europeans
ordinarily bathe in this way daily during
the hot season; and, on some occasions,
even the pious Hindu resorts to the same domestic
ablution; though it is held far inferior to
immersion in the Ganges, or in such stream as
should, by being within a reasonable distance,
preclude all pleas of inconvenience. Bigots
will often travel several miles to be laved by the
holy fluid; while others will scarcely go as
many yards to enjoy that reputed blessing. All,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>however, must conform, to a certain extent, to
the law; and it is but justice to say, that, whether
owing to habit, or to veneration, the number
of trespasses is very, very limitted. We
may suppose, that, in so hot a climate, bathing
must be a luxury; this should be taken <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>cum
grano salis</em></span>; for, at some seasons, the waters
are by no means inviting: I have often gone
into a bath in December and January, when the
sensations were truly painful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mahomedans, in opulent circumstances, and
especially those of rank, generally have baths
lined with marble, or with masonry, in some
private apartments, to which their families can
have immediate access. These baths are sometimes
furnished with the means of having water
heated to any temperature; as is invariably the case
with all the public baths to be seen at Calcutta,
and the several great cities throughout the East.
These baths, which are called <em>hummums</em>, (whence
we have derived the term,) are extremely convenient;
and, if properly used, no less conducive
to health. It is necessary, after quitting
them, to be extremely cautious in allowing
access to the atmospheric temperature, on account
of the perfect cleansing given to the skin,
by the attendants, who by means of <em>hautties</em>,
(a kind of glove, made of hair, or very coarse
wool,) bring off such a quantity of scurf as
astonishes those who consider themselves to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>very cleanly in their persons. These men cause
every joint in the bather’s whole frame to crack;
thereby giving, sometimes, no inconsiderable
pain: to this, however, the natives are so fully
accustomed, as to consider it absolutely a luxury.
Although the <em>hummums</em> are much frequented
by Mahomedans, yet, I believe, they
are chiefly supported by the resort of Armenians,
Greeks, Portugueze, and English gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The waters throughout the East are infested
by alligators of an enormous size; of which,
some are most sanguinary depredators. It often
happens that a bather is carried off daily from
a <em>ghaut</em>, perhaps for a fortnight in succession;
when the evil is put a stop to by some lucky
shot, which either kills the alligator, or causes
him to quit the vicinity. Such is the faith
entertained by all the natives, whether Mussulmans
or Hindus, regarding predestination, that,
although, on such occasions, they proceed to
the <em>ghaut</em> with obvious apprehension, they allow
no intermission to take place in the ablutionary
duties, on account of those depredations they
may have daily witnessed for some time before.
This species of absurdity may be discovered, in
a thousand shapes, in the conduct of predestinarians,
who affect to believe in that previous
arrangement which renders all human precaution
unavailing. These persons, at the same time,
shew great anxiety to have the alligator killed;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>consequently, may be fairly considered as aiming
to subvert the ordinations of fate!</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the native women retained by European
gentlemen very rarely proceed to the
rivers to bathe, but content themselves with
either the use of a small bath of masonry, or
with pots of water, they are, nevertheless, extremely
fond of going abroad in a <em>palanquin</em>,
or a <em>r’hut</em>, attended by their <em>dhyes</em>, and with
the <em>guttah-tope</em>, or cover, of the vehicle, brought
down close on all sides. It certainly would
be uncharitable to annex a bad motive, as inseparable
from <em>all</em> such excursions, yet it may
probably be considered as a general rule, that
such ladies either take the air with the intention
of meeting some established gallant, or
that they ultimately give way to the flattery and
whisperings of their menials, who are rarely
proof against a very moderate bribe, and are frequently
known to throw an admirer, as though
accidentally, in the way of Madam’s notice.</p>

<p class='c008'>However recluse we may suppose the Hindostanee
ladies to be, some allowance must be made
for certain amusements peculiar to India, in
which they indulge. The acceptance and transmission
of compliments and civilities, afford no
small gratification; the arrival, or despatch, of a
complimentary <em>pawn</em>, (beetle,) or of an <em>elauҫhee</em>,
(cardamom,) being matters of considerable importance,
among a race whose whole time may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>be said to be devoted to whatever is childish or
insignificant. When visits are paid, much ceremony
is used, and every endeavor is exerted, on
either part, to appear well-bred and affable; on
such occasions, a profusion of compliments are
exchanged, while each narrowly observes the
dress, the equipage, and the conduct of the
other, but reserves her observations until a free
vent may be given to envy and jealousy; not forgetting
a little scandal.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some ladies affect to possess a musical ear, and
exercise not only their own lungs, but those of
their attendants also, in vociferating various
common-place songs, accompanying their captivating
strains with tremendous thumps on a large
long drum, called a <em>dhole</em>; or perhaps shewing
the agility of their fingers in playing upon a very
small kind of tambourine, called a <em>coonjerry</em>.
Woe be to that kind-keeper who should dissent
from the fair one’s opinion, regarding either the
excellence of her performance, or the pleasing
tones of the instruments! Where this infatuation
exists, the whole neighbourhood is compelled
to submit to the nuisance. There would
be no use in remonstrating with the lady, through
the medium of her servants: and as to parleying
with the gentleman on such a subject, that would
give great offence; or, at all events, would be
unavailing. The man who submits to such an
uproar, ‘for the sake of a <em>quiet</em> life’, may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>considered a living illustration of Shakespeare’s
ludicrous, but most wholesome lesson,—‘The
ewe that will not hear its lamb when it bleats,
will never attend to a calf when it baes.’ In
truth, some of these ladies ride upon very high
horses, and keep the whip-hand most manfully!
a circumstance we should by no means expect,
after hearing, perhaps, that their respective names
were ‘<em>Chembayly</em>’, (jasmine,) ‘<em>Golaub</em>’, (rose-water,)
‘<em>Miscery</em>’, (sugar,) ‘<em>Gool-beegum</em>’,
(queen of roses,) ‘<em>Meevah-Jehan</em>’, (the fruit of
life:) though, perhaps, those known by the name
of ‘<em>Soorooj</em>’, (<i>i.e.</i> the sun,) might lay claim to
some authority, without acting so grossly in
opposition to their nomenclature.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we consider the very severe privation
experienced by females in general, (for our
country-women often affect to adopt the recluse
severities of the <em>haram</em>;) it cannot appear surprizing,
that young girls so immured, in such a
climate, so indulged occasionally, and so beset
with bawds, should allow themselves to be led
astray from what I must, perhaps erroneously,
call ‘the ways of chastity.’ I am aware, that the
term may offend many, who consider the female
as being already in a state of prostitution; but
due allowance must be made for the usages of
the country. In India, a woman ‘<em>under the
protection</em>’ of an European gentleman, is accounted,
not only among the natives, but even by his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>countrymen, to be equally sacred, as though
she were married to him; and the woman
herself, values her reputation, exactly in proportion
as she may have refrained from indulging
in variety: some are said to have passed twenty
years, or more, without the possibility for scandal
to attach to their conduct. We might
further take into consideration, that, even
according to the Mahomedan law, there are
various degrees of connubial attachment, from
the strictest, and most formal, union, down to
what we should call a very loose kind of left-handed
marriage. These are, however, sanctioned
by that law, if performed according to
enjoined ceremonies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now, the greater part, we may say nine in
ten, of those who domiciliate with Europeans,
being Mussulmans, and, in many cases, very
scrupulous in the observance of whatever
forms are ordained respecting viands, contact,
ablution, &amp;c., it may be reasonably concluded,
that they rather deem themselves to be united
according to a tolerated extension of the foregoing
licences, than as retained prostitutes.
Therefore, when we consider received opinions,
and local peculiarities, we may admit, that,
even in what we term concubinage, there may
be some traits exempting individuals from
being confounded among that mass of prostitution,
of which we are apt to form our judgments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>by what we see of that depravity, from which it
appears to be, among Europeans, nearly inseparable!
Without at all entering upon the defence
of whatever may be inhibited by the Christian
religion, or be inimical to that superiority so
justly yielded by society at large, as well as by
the legislature, to married women, it may be permitted
me to state a few matters which will, in
the minds of the liberal, appear to be some excuse
for what might else be deemed libidinous, or
licentious. The number of European women
to be found in Bengal, and its dependencies,
cannot amount to two hundred and fifty, while
the European male inhabitants of respectability,
including military officers, may be taken at about
four thousand. The case speaks for itself; for,
even if disposed to marry, the latter have not
the means. It is easy enough to say, that if
marriages were more frequent in India, more
ladies would adventure thither; but the impediments
that stand in the way of ‘a consummation
devoutly to be wished,’ will not be found
to yield so readily to our desires. It should be
understood, that the generality of young ladies,
though they may certainly comply with the will
of their parents, are by no means partial to
visiting India. The out-fit is not a trifle: no
lady can be landed there, under respectable circumstances
throughout, for less than five hundred
pounds. Then, again, she should have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>friends to receive her; for she cannot else obtain
even a lodging, or the means of procuring
subsistence. It is not like a trip, <em>per hoy</em>, to
Margate, where nothing but a well-lined purse
is requisite; and where, if you do not meet with
friends, you may easily form acquaintances.
Further, some allowance must be made for the
climate; which by no means suits every constitution,
and invariably oppresses all whose minds
are ill at ease, or who have not the means of
withstanding that influence, so particularly hostile
to persons newly importing from Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let us, however, suppose all these things to
be done; and that some worthy dame welcomes
the fair adventurer to her house, with the
friendly intention of affording an asylum, until
some stray bachelor may bear away the prize.
We have known some instances of this, and, in
particular, of a lady making it, in a manner, her
study to replenish her hospitable mansion
with objects of this description; thereby acquiring
the invidious, or sarcastic, designation of ‘Mother
Coupler’. But such characters are rare;
and it generally happens, that those who have
the will, do not possess the means, of thus rendering
the most essential of services to young
women, who, we may fairly say, are, in this
case, transported to India, there to take their
chance! That several have been thus sent, or,
have thus adventured, round the Cape, cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>be denied; in any other country they would have
experienced the most poignant distress, both of
body and of mind; but, such has ever been the
liberality evinced towards this class of unfortunate
persons, that, in most instances, prompt,
and effectual, relief, has been administered. It
would be easy to adduce cases, wherein the
most bountiful subscriptions have been made
in behalf of ladies; who, by obeying the summons
of husbands, or of parents, have, on
arriving in the river, found themselves to be
widows, or orphans! Surely, where these distressing
events are by no means uncommon, there
will ever exist a certain reluctance, even among
such as may have relatives in India: a reluctance
which will rarely be decreased by the additional
consideration, that, when the vessel may arrive,
the parent, &amp;c., though alive, may be full a thousand
miles distant from the metropolis, and be
unable to reach it under two or three months!
Here we see formidable objections against a lady’s
proceeding to India; but one, not less powerful,
remains to be stated, namely, the immense expence
ever attendant upon wedlock in that quarter.
Such is the encrease of domestics, of
cloathing, of accommodation and, particularly,
in keeping a carriage, without which no comfort
can be expected, that it is utterly beyond
the means of full four persons in five to receive
an European lady into their houses. Even on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>penurious scale, the difference will amount to
full three hundred pounds yearly; but if, as is
certainly desirable, it be conducted on a more
appropriate footing, double that sum must be
allowed. Add to this, the peremptory necessity
that exists, for sending every child to Europe at
a very early age; the expence of which is never
to be computed under a hundred and fifty
pounds. To complete the difficulties attendant
on the occasion, it is a thousand to one, but,
that, at the end of a few years, the mother is
compelled, by those peculiar infirmities inseparable
from her situation in that climate, to accompany
her infants to Europe; there to seek
the restoration of health, and to console herself
among her little offspring, until the father may,
notwithstanding those heavy demands created
by the wants of his family, be able to save sufficient
money to repair to the objects of his affection.
This is no exaggeration: it is to be witnessed
annually; and may be seen attended with
the most distressing effects to most meritorious
individuals, who unfortunately allow love to
walk in at the door, without observing that
poverty is treading upon her train.</p>

<p class='c008'>I trust this detail will convince, even the
sceptic, that matrimony is not so practicable in
India as in Europe; and that, (unless, indeed,
among those platonic few whose passions are
unnaturally obedient,) is impossible for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>generality of European inhabitants to act in exact
conformity with those excellent doctrines, which
teach us to avoid ‘fornication, and all other
deadly sins.’ There are certain situations, and
times, in which the law must be suffered to
sleep; since its enforcement would neither be
easy nor wise: such is the instance now before
us. Should it be argued, that, rather than retain
a concubine, it were more proper to marry a
native of India, I must then adduce the great
discouragement wisely held out by government
against such a practice; observing, that the
Court of Directors long ago set their faces against
the transmission of native orphans, (<i>i.e.</i> those
born of native mothers,) and, that they allow no
native of India to be taken as a passenger on
board any vessel proceeding to England, without
a deposit of 500 sicca rupees, or security to that
amount, lest the party should become a burthen
to the Company. Further, no lady, native of
India, even though her father should have been
of the highest rank in the King’s or Company’s
service, and though she be married to a person
of that description, is ever invited to those assemblies
given by the governor on public occasions.
Hence, such women, whatever may be
their merits, come under the censure of public
characters, and, of course, are in a manner proscribed.
This, however, does not extend to the
European soldiery, who are allowed to marry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>native women; many of whom conduct themselves,
when thus situated, in the most unexceptionable
manner. Whether married, or not,
each soldier is generally provided with a companion,
who takes care of his linen, aids in cleaning
his accoutrements, dresses his hair, and
sometimes proves no bad hand at a beard!
These doxies do, certainly, now and then, kick
up a famous <em>row</em> in the barracks; but, on the
whole, may be considered highly serviceable;
especially during illness, at which time their
attendance is invaluable.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very few European women are to be seen
with the regiments in India; such as adventure thither,
soon fall victims to the climate, which
nothing but the most vigorous constitutions,
backed by temperance and uncommon prudence,
can enable the sex to resist. Hence, the few
that survive, though they present rather a masculine
appearance, find it expedient to confine
themselves much within the barracks; keeping
out of the sun, and avoiding the use of strong
liquors. The children of such women usually
prove remarkably hardy; whereas, the issue of
an European father by a native woman, is usually
of an effeminate, weakly constitution, and of
a disposition by no means entitled to commendation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is peculiarly unfortunate, that a very great
portion of these creoles, mestees, or what not,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>cannot be provided for in some manner serviceable
to the state. Their numbers are considerable,
especially of females, who are allowed to
remain with the orphan institution, often to a
very mature age: some are, to be sure, disposed
of in services, where they become attendants,
or ladies’ maids, in respectable families;
but, for the most part, no certain provision
is made for them. Probably it is owing to reflection,
as much as to their arriving at puberty,
that so many of these unfortunate girls become
insane. This does not occur among the boys;
who are either apprenticed to some good business,
if of the upper school, (in which only the
children of officers are admitted,) or, if of the
lower school, (wherein the children of the non-commissioned
and privates are brought up,) are
draughted, at a proper age, to the several regiments,
both native and European, there to serve
as drummers and fifers. While upon the subject,
I shall offer to my readers the outline of
the Orphan Institution, now so intimately
blended with the military establishments
throughout India, that the Company make it a
part of their regulations, for all persons admitted
into their military service, to become, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ipso facto</em></span>,
subscribers to the orphan fund.</p>

<p class='c008'>This charitable institution, which does singular
honor to the Company’s army, owes its origin
to the assiduity of a few officers, who, in 1782,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>framed a code, founded upon the result of voluntary
subscription, for making due provision for
the children of such officers as might demise,
without leaving sufficient property to provide
for their children, whether legitimate or otherwise.
Among the gentlemen who suggested
this undertaking, the present Colonel William
Kirkpatrick was conspicuous: he was at that
time secretary to the late General Giles Stibbert,
who then commanded the Bengal army, and
aided the institution by every public means, as
well as by his private influence and bounty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following were among the preliminary
articles. ‘1st. That each subaltern, and assistant
surgeon, contribute monthly the sum of
three rupees; each captain, and surgeon, six
rupees; and each major, nine rupees.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘2dly. That, to prevent difficulty and expence
in the collections, as well as to secure
their amount against all accidents, the officers
do consent, <em>irrevocably</em>, to the deduction of the
specified contributions from their monthly pay.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘4th. That a governor, deputy-governor, and
twelve managers, be appointed to conduct the
business of the society.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘12th. That no orphan be admitted on the
foundation, who shall be possessed by inheritance,
bequest, or otherwise, of a sum exceeding
5,000 sicca rupees.’ (£425.)</p>

<p class='c008'>‘l3th. That the trustees, or guardians, of all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>orphans making application for their admission
on the foundation, be required to make affidavit,
before a justice of the peace, touching the true
amount or value of the monies, or estate, which
they hold in trust for such orphans; to the end,
that the management, besides being satisfied
that they are proper objects for the institution,
may be enabled to judge what assistance they
will need from the society, when, their education
being completed, the period shall arrive for
settling them in the world: these affidavits to be
transmitted to the management, along with the
application for admission.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘15th. That all orphans now in the country,
coming under the description set forth, be admitted
on the foundation, so soon as the management
may judge the state of the fund equal to
their maintenance.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘19th. That the orphans be assembled together
at the presidency, either in one or more
houses, as the management shall find necessary;
and, that proper servants be appointed to attend
them.’</p>

<p class='c008'>‘25th. That, on the female orphans attaining
the age of twelve, they be placed apprentices
to creditable milliners, mantua-makers, stay-makers
or otherwise, as the management, or
their agents, shall determine; and, that, after
serving their time, they shall obtain from the society
the necessary help towards enabling them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>to set up in business. That should they, at the
period of their engaging in business, be disposed
to enter into the matrimonial state, they shall be
further entitled to receive such marriage portions,
or dowries, as the management, or their
agents in England, (whose approbation of the
connexion shall be previously yielded,) may
think proper to grant.’ In the year 1789, it was
resolved, that ‘when the orphan daughters of
officers, under the protection of the society, are
addressed by persons in independent circumstances,
such persons be required to make a
settlement, as a condition; without which the
managers’ consent is not to be given, even if the
offer should be, in other respects, unexceptionable.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Notwithstanding the institution was placed
under the guidance and control of men highly
respectable, and perfectly qualified for the
charge, and that the whole of the officers, (with
the exception of, I believe, not more than six,)
subscribed towards its support, the object would
have been defeated, had not the Company contributed
liberally towards its efficiency; and,
after all, it would most certainly have been subject,
either to diminution, or, eventually, to
bankruptcy, about the year 1796, had not the
army been newly modelled, and an immense
addition been made to the funds, by an unprecedented
promotion and the ascent of the superior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>ranks to subscribe in proportion to their pay:
otherwise, all above the rank of major would
have been exempt. The Company had, in
former times, allowed for each child born to an
European soldier, the sum of five rupees monthly;
but that indulgence was, at one period,
wholly done away: afterwards, when the institution
was extended to the non-commissioned
and privates, three rupees were allowed monthly
for every child retained with the parents, according
to the liberty granted of retaining them
until completing their third year; after which,
they were peremptorily taken to the lower
school, where they were at first allowed for by
the Company at the rate of three rupees, but
subsequently at five rupees each, per mensem.
It is not easy to describe those affecting scenes
which present themselves, when the children
are taken from their parents, in order to be sent
to the foundation! It is true, the latter know
full well that every justice will be done to their
offspring, and they cannot but express their
sense of the kind intention of their benefactors;
but, to part from a child, whatever may be its
complexion, is a most painful struggle between
duty and nature! I have repeatedly witnessed
the distress of mothers, on such occasions, and
lamented that the case admitted of neither consolation
nor relief!</p>

<p class='c008'>The good policy of making some provision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>for the children of the soldiery, is indisputably
good; they could not, with propriety, be sent
to Europe, both because the expence would
be disproportionate to the means of their parents;
and, that, in time, a very extensive importation
of persons of color would take place
among us. The boys are now amply provided
for; but the situation of the girls is truly lamentable.
It is wonderful, that the Society have
never established any factory, in which their
minds, as well as their hands, could be employed,
while their maintenance would be paid
for by the produce of their industry. The only
argument I ever could hear urged against such
a measure, was, that the price of labor being so
cheap throughout India, there could arise but
little profit from the exertions of the orphans.
My opponents forgot, that where labor is cheap,
provisions must be cheap also; consequently,
that, under proper guidance, enough might be
earned to defray the expence of provision for
the whole establishment. I am confident, that,
if the refuse, or <em>ferret</em> cloths, manufactured for
the Company, were to be handed over, in such
quantities as might be in demand, to the female
orphans, for the purpose of being worked up
into wearing apparel, such as shirts, under-shirts,
drawers, pocket-handkerchiefs, neck ditto,
upper and under waistcoats, small-cloaths, &amp;c.
there would always be so extensive a sale,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>especially among the lower classes of inhabitants,
the sea-faring people, and the fresh arrivals
from Europe, that no stock would remain
on hand. It is a notorious fact, that if raw silk,
after being wound off from the <em>cocoons</em>, or pods,
were to be given to the orphans to finish, and
to reel properly for the Europe market, there
would be an immense saving both of the article
itself, and of the expences in every part of
the adventure; while the institution could not
fail to derive the most solid advantages. To
prove this, look at the number of mills established
in various parts of England, for preparing
raw silk for the throwster, &amp;c.: in all these, a
portion of refuse is found; on which, however,
as well as on the perfect quantity, a very heavy
duty has been paid, whereby the commodity is
considerably enhanced in price, without being a
benefit to the merchant; who is, indeed, rather
injured, by the necessity he is under of demanding
more for his fabrics, and thus, either
deterring purchasers altogether, of enabling the
traders of other countries to under-sell him.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, in Calcutta, a city carrying on so large a
trade, surely there must be an infinite variety of
speculations open to the choice of the management:
the lighter classes of sails for the shipping
and small craft, the making of hammocks, beddings,
&amp;c., dresses for patients in the hospitals, sheets,
pillow-cases, book-binding to a certain extent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>and a number of other employments, might be
peremptorily claimed, as exclusive privileges
for the orphans. Let it not be said, that such
would interfere with the natives following
similar professions; on the contrary, let us endeavor
to have our whole establishment, of
every description, exempted from their aid, or
interference. I would have every cartridge-case,
and the greater part of the army cloathing,
together with all, excepting the leather, and
heavy canvas-work of tents, performed at the
orphan school; the Company making due remuneration
for the work thus performed. The
fact lies in a nut-shell! If, with such extensive
concerns, requiring so much manual labor, the
Company do not give employ to five or six
hundred girls, from three to twenty years of age,
the fault must assuredly lie rather among the
management than with Government; to which
the making some provision for the maintenance
of that portion of the establishment dependant
entirely upon the Company for support, must
be a desideratum: it can only require to be
pointed out, to insure both acquiescence and
encouragement.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Court of Directors very prudently objected
to some of the original articles, wherein
the founders appear to have been rather too
sanguine, and to have waived several considerations
of a political nature. Thus, the Company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>declined to warrant admission into their service
of such boys as might appear eligible as cadets;
the measure was incompatible with the patronage
of the Court; and, being indefinitely expressed,
would have subjected the Company
to a pledge, that even the sons of the native
women might be considered eligible. It was,
therefore, prudently resolved, that ‘the children
to be sent to Europe for education, should be the
legitimate offspring of European parents only.’</p>

<p class='c008'>The salaries of the several persons employed
in the charge of those on the foundation, are
munificent. The house at Kidderpore, about a
mile and a half from Fort-William, is paid
for at the rate of £675. per annum, and the monthly
disbursements for school-masters and mistresses,
with their assistants, and the several servants
employed about the premises, in various capacities,
amount to full £l2,000. yearly. The
children are boarded at the following rates: The
sons of officers at about £14. yearly, on average;
the daughters of officers at about the
same rate; the master and mistress having, respectively,
always a certain number daily at
their own tables. The children of non-commissioned
officers and soldiers are maintained at
an average expence, for diet, of about £5. each.
The secretary is allowed £450. for salary, house-rent,
candles, and, other petty charges.</p>

<p class='c008'>With respect to making provision for the sons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>of officers, there seems but little doubt: the
great encrease of mercantile establishments in
Calcutta, and in general throughout the country,
has opened a wide field for the employment of
numbers conversant with the Hindui and Bengallee
languages, (which the orphans acquire habitually,)
and with common accounts. It is to
be lamented, that so few, if any, are sent on
board the pilot-schooners, according to a clause
in the original institution, or as mates on board
the country-traders. They certainly would be
far better qualified, for such situations, than
Europeans, who are totally ignorant of the vernacular
tongue, and whose constitutions are by
no means so well adapted to the climate. With
respect to placing creoles of any description in
authority, whether civil or military, there can
be but one opinion; since their admission, into
either the one or the other, could not fail to
lessen that respect, and deference, which ought
most studiously to be exacted, on every occasion,
from the natives of every rank.</p>

<p class='c008'>The expences attendant upon sending children
from India to Europe, are very considerable:
few commanders of Indiamen will take a
child for less than 800 sicca rupees, equal to
£100.; and, even then, some attendant must
be provided, whose passage will probably
amount to as much more. The best mode is,
for several parents to hire a small cabin between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>decks, and to send a woman in charge of their
united families, to the number, perhaps, of
five or six little ones; all of whom may be thus
duly attended, at far less expence than if each
were sent under a separate charge. Few Europeans’
children are kept in India beyond their
third or fourth year; and it is generally an
object that the small-pox, or vaccination, the
measles, and the hooping-cough, should have
been passed previous to embarkation; lest infection
should take place on board, in consequence
of the seamen, &amp;c., having been among
persons laboring under those complaints. It
is, indeed, likewise a matter of policy, considering
the heavy expence, and the trouble attendant,
to have all those dangerous diseases
out of the way, previous to shipping the children
for England; where they might else, on
landing, be carried off by them, thus rendering
all their parents’ anxiety, and possibly their ill-spared
disbursements, of no avail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vaccination was expected to have made a
very powerful impression on the Hindus, who,
it was supposed, would eagerly embrace a preventive
arising from that animal, held so sacred
by their whole sect. It was, nevertheless,
found extremely difficult to induce the Bramins
to adopt a practice obviously so beneficial
to mankind, although the latitude was thereby
given them of augmenting the attributes of their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>idol, and to claim a preference in its behalf,
even over the whole of the Christian world.
Those who were sanguine in their expectations,
of vaccination being instantly adopted among
the Hindus at large, had entirely forgot, that
the people did not possess the smallest liberty,
either of conscience, or of conduct: they forgot
that the priesthood had become possessed
of the most arbitrary power, over the minds of
their peaceful and timid communicants; and,
that the practice of inoculation was prescriptively
confined to that priesthood: further, that,
notwithstanding the veneration in which the
cow was held among them, a serious objection
existed, on account of the matter being taken
from any but a Hindu of the highest cast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vaccine inoculation was effected with
great difficulty in India; an immense number
of experiments failed, chiefly owing to the
<em>virus</em> having been destroyed on the way from
Constantinople, whence matter was repeatedly
forwarded by Lord Elgin to Dr. Short, at Bagdad.
A whole year was passed under the most
mortifying disappointments; but in June, 1802,
a successful inoculation was made at Bombay,
on a healthy child, about three years of age;
which furnished a supply for every port of
India. By shipping several children, who had
never experienced the variolous inoculation, a
succession of subjects was happily secured,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>which enabled Dr. Anderson to transmit the
blessings afforded by this mitigated disease,
even to Port Jackson. The greatest apprehensions
entertained, arose from the danger of not
being always provided with a succession of infective
matter; for it was soon discovered, that
the <em>virus</em> was highly volatile, and often made
its escape in conveying the <em>pus</em> from one house
to another. This, added to the necessity, which
soon became apparent, for the formation of some
depôt, and for the establishment of certain
principles necessary towards the desired success,
caused the Governor-General to nominate
Mr. William Russell, of the Bengal Medical
List, whose abilities and zeal peculiarly
qualified him, to the important situation of
Superintendant of the Vaccine Institution. A
series of ill health, which ultimately compelled
that gentleman to return to Europe, caused
the records of the first months to be somewhat
inaccurate, notwithstanding every exertion on
his part. His assiduity, however, enabled him
to register almost every child, born of European
parents, at that time in the settlement, among
those who received this benign and inoffensive
substitute for the most malignant, loathsome,
and fatal disease that ever afflicted the human
race.</p>

<p class='c008'>In aid of what was doing at the Presidency,
several of the surgeons attached to the civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>stations, and to divisions of the army serving
at great distances, and in various directions,
were interested to promulgate the happy issue
of what had been attempted by Mr. Russell,
and by his successor, Mr. Shoolbred, Surgeon
to the Native Hospital. Nevertheless, notwithstanding
such excellent precautions, the matter
was at times very nearly extinct; more than
once the establishments at the several country
stations were completely destitute, and were
obliged to obtain a fresh supply from the Presidency:
however, during the first eighteen
months, no less than 11,166 persons were vaccinated;
a matter of great importance, when it
is considered, that, in India, at least one in
sixty dies of those inoculated with the small-pox.
About the year 1787, an order had been
issued, that all the European soldiers in the
Company’s service, who bore no marks of having
had the disease, should be inoculated, and be
lodged in the Artillery Hospital at Dum Dum.
A few years after, (the former operation having
proved highly successful,) the order was repeated;
the result was, however, very unfavorable;
as full one-sixth of the patients were
carried off. It is to be hoped, that, in due
time, when the natives at large may be thoroughly
convinced of the security afforded by
vaccination, the small-pox will be but little
known. Its communication by insertion being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>now very strictly prohibited in Calcutta, and its
neighbourhood, will, no doubt, pave the way
for the progress of vaccination, and weaken the
influence of the Bramins, who are interested
in variolous inoculation. It is singular, that,
at the very moment when this crafty tribe were
endeavoring to depreciate, or rather to explode,
vaccination, there started up among them a
claim to the knowledge, and practice, of the
latter at Bareilly, where inoculation was almost
unknown. An attempt was made to prove, on
the authority of a very ancient Sanscrit book,
entitled, ‘<em>Sud’has Angraha</em>,’ and written by a
physician, whose name was <em>Mahadeva</em>, that
vaccination was practised in India many centuries
back. On examining other copies of the
work, it was found, that the passage quoted
from that produced at Bareilly was wanting;
this, added to other circumstances, rendered
the tale rather doubtful, and led to such
an investigation as proved fatal to the imposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a great pity the deception was ever
discovered; since nothing could have aided the
views of government better, than the testimony
of such an ancient authority, of the practice
having been formerly common in Hindostan!
We were certainly wrong in publishing that
refutation, which deprived us of the best weapon
we could have employed for the extension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>of our pursuit. In lieu of decrying the work
in question, as ‘an impudent forgery, interpolated
into a Sanscrit-book, by one of those frauds
so commonly, and so dexterously, committed
by the Hindu literati, for the purpose of supporting
the claims of the Bramins to the prior
possession of all kinds of science,’ we ought
to have assented fully to that imposition; allowing
the priests to enjoy the supposed antiquity
of their knowledge, and contenting ourselves
with the contemplation of those immense
benefits produced by the concurrence in, or
adoption of, our practice, by those infatuated
foster-fathers. But the struggle for reputation
caused us to quit our hold, in the most impolitic,
and thoughtless manner!</p>

<p class='c008'>It may not be unpleasing to my readers, to be
informed as to the manner in which the <em>Bramins</em>,
or Hindu priests, who are the only persons
of that sect allowed to inoculate, perform
the operation: the following extract from Mr.
Shoolbred’s treatise shews, that no alteration
has taken place since Mr. Holwell, from whom
Mr. S. quotes, gave the public an account of
their practice, viz.</p>

<p class='c008'>‘Inoculation is performed in Hindostan by a
particular tribe of <em>Bramins</em>, who are delegated
annually for this service, from the different colleges
of <em>Bindoobund</em>, <em>Allahabas</em>, <em>Benares</em>, &amp;c.,
over all the distant provinces. Dividing themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>into small parties, of three or four each,
they plan their travelling circuits in such wise,
as to arrive at the places of their respective destinations
some weeks before the usual return of
the disease. They arrive commonly in the
Bengal provinces early in February; although,
in some years, they do not begin to inoculate
before March, deferring it until they consider
the state of the season, and acquire information
of the state of the distemper. The inhabitants
of Bengal, knowing the usual time when the
inoculating Bramins annually return, observe
strictly the regimen enjoined, whether they
determine to be inoculated or not: this precaution
consists only in abstaining for a month
from fish, milk, and <em>ghee</em> (a kind of butter,
made generally from buffalo’s milk). The prohibition
of fish relates only to the native Portugueze
and Mahomedans, who abound in every
province of the empire. When the Bramins
begin to inoculate, they pass from house to
house, and operate at the door, refusing to inoculate
any who have not, on a strict scrutiny,
duly observed the preparatory course enjoined
them. It is no uncommon thing for them to
ask the parent how many pocks they choose
the children should have. They inoculate indifferently
on any part, but, if left to their
choice, they prefer the outside of the arm, midway
between the wrist and the elbow, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>the shoulders of females. Previous to the operation,
the Bramin takes a piece of cloth in
his hand, (which, if the family is opulent, becomes
his perquisite,) and with it gives a dry
friction on the part intended for inoculation,
for the space of eight or ten minutes; then,
with a small instrument, he wounds by many
slight touches, about the compass of a silver
groat, just causing the smallest appearance of
blood. Then opening a double linen rag, which
he always keeps in a cloth round his waist, he
thence takes a small pledget of cotton, charged
with the variolous matter, which he moistens
with two or three drops of the Ganges water,
and applies to the wound; fixing it on with a
slight bandage, and ordering it to remain on
for six hours without being moved: the bandage
is after that time taken off, but the pledget
remains until it falls off of itself. The cotton,
which he preserves in a double calico rag, is saturated
with matter from the inoculated pustules
of the preceding year; for they never inoculate
with fresh matter, nor with matter from the disease
caught in the natural way, however distinct and
mild the species. Early in the morning succeeding
the operation, four pots, containing
about two gallons each, of cold water, are ordered
to be thrown over the patient from the
head downwards, and to be repeated every
morning and evening, until the fever comes on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>which usually is about the close of the sixth
day from the inoculation, then to desist until
the appearance of the eruption, (about three
days,) and afterwards to pursue the cold bathing,
as before, through the course of the disease, and
until the scabs of the pustules drop off. They
are ordered to open all the pustules with a
sharp-pointed thorn, so soon as they begin to
change their color, and whilst the matter continues
in a fluid state. Confinement to the
house is absolutely forbidden; and the inoculated
are to be exposed to every air that blows; the
utmost indulgence they are allowed, when the
fever comes on, is, to be laid on a mat at the
door. Their regimen is to consist of all the
refrigerating things the climate and the season
produce; as plantains, sugar-canes, water-melons,
rice, gruel made of white poppy seeds,
and cold water, or thin rice gruel, for their
ordinary drink. These instructions being given,
and an injunction laid on the patients to make a
thanksgiving, (<em>poojah</em>,) or offering to the goddess,
on their recovery, the operator takes his fee,
which, from a poor person, is a <em>punn</em> of <em>cowries</em>,
(in number eighty, and in value about a half-penny,)
and goes on to another door, down one
side of the street, and up the other; and is
thus employed from morning till night, inoculating
sometimes eight or ten in a house.’</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Shoolbred observes, on the authority of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>Mr. Glass, the surgeon at Boglepore, that, in
that district, inoculation is performed by the
lowest casts. This is certainly true among the
<em>Pahariahs</em>, or Hill people, inhabiting that mountainous
country lying between Boglepore and
Nagpore. There, inoculation is performed in a
very rough manner, merely by means of a blunt
instrument, which, with some labor to the operator,
and abundance of pain to the patient, is
made to draw blood: the matter is then rubbed
in with the finger!</p>

<p class='c008'>These same <em>Pahariahs</em> perform other surgical
operations in the rudest way, but with most extraordinary
success; thus, they cut capons with
a blunt clasp knife, made of iron; which, having
a ring passed through the butt of the haft,
or sheath, is always suspended by a cord passing
round the waist. With this instrument, they
make the necessary incision, so as to introduce
a finger; when, having extracted the <em>testes</em>, the
wound is rubbed with a little <em>ghee</em> and turmeric,
and almost invariably heals in a very few days.
It may be considered curious, that among the
<em>D’hangahs</em>, (as the people who appear to be the
aborigines of Tamar, Chittrah, Puchate, are
designated,) very few instances, in proportion to
the bulk of their population, are to be found,
of persons marked with the small pox; I should
be disposed to attribute this entirely to the simplicity
of their manner of living; in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>plain rice, with a few vegetables, stewed, much
the same as for a <em>curry</em>, but without its catalogue
of spices, compose the ordinary bill of
fare. It cannot be owing to any thing favorable
in the climate, which is peculiarly unhealthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hospital for the reception of natives requiring
surgical assistance, now supported in
Calcutta by voluntary contribution, was founded
about the year 1793; before which time, those
unfortunate persons who met with accidents had
no asylum, wherein they could find either
solace or remedy. The establishment is, as yet,
rather limitted; but, it is to be hoped, will, in
the course of a few years, rise superior to the
disadvantages under which it labors, in consequence
of the great expence incurred in lodging
the patients, many of whom labor under complaints
purely clinical; contrary to the first
intention, and indeed, to the first proposal for
such a charity, which was started about 1791,
in a letter published in ‘the World,’ (a Calcutta
weekly paper,) addressed to the Reverend
——— Owen, one of the chaplains at the Presidency.</p>

<p class='c008'>In that letter was suggested the expediency
of causing all those deformed persons who infest
the streets of Calcutta, in quest of eleemosynary
aid, to be sent to some hospital, which should
likewise accommodate such natives as might
be injured by accidents within the city. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>proposal was founded on the peremptory necessity
for conducting all upon the cheapest plan;
and contained a calculation of the expences
incident to the construction of thatched ranges
of huts, similar to barracks, to be erected on a
piece of ground to be granted by government
for that purpose. The whole expence, it appeared,
would not have amounted to more than
£1,500., or £2,000. yearly, yet full accommodation,
and subsistence, would have been
afforded for three hundred patients.</p>

<p class='c008'>The idea of permanence, which is usually
supposed to carry with it cheapness, was, I
understand, the plea for deviating from the proposed
economical estimate: the consequence
has been, that the number of patients is extremely
limitted. That original expence will,
in most countries, be found far cheaper than a
flimsy beginning attended with constant demands
for repair, cannot be doubted; but,
where there is no capital, at least a very small
one, it is absurd to act upon the former scale;
since it must, of necessity, counteract the
whole intention. Further, we should consider
local circumstances: thus, in Calcutta, the
same money that will cover in accommodations
for a thousand persons, under a substantial
thatch, laid over mud, or mat walls, adequate
to the ordinary purposes of the inhabitants at
large, and similar to at least ninety-nine in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>hundred, of those habitations which shelter the
bulk of the population; would not suffice to provide
fifty, of the same description, with apartments
formed of masonry, timber, &amp;c., according to the
scale on which Europeans build houses for their
own residence, within that city. It is likewise a
well-known fact, that, what is called a <em>puckah-house</em>,
that is, one built of bricks, lime, and
timber, will, at the end of ten years, cost as
much in repairs, as the thatched edifices built
for an equal number of inhabitants. This being
the case, it will forcibly strike the reader, that,
in departing from the original suggestion, the
managers likewise departed from the best principle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been vain-gloriously asserted, within my
hearing, by many natives, that, although the
institution in question was founded by Europeans,
yet, that it has been principally upheld
by the liberality of opulent natives. This may,
perhaps, be in some measure correct; allowing
it, however, to be so to the fullest extent, I
cannot see that the natives have done more than
an ordinary duty, in affording assistance to their
own countrymen, and that too, after being
urged, or guided, to the measure; while, on
the other hand, the European inhabitants may
certainly claim the palm, both as original founders,
and subsequent benefactors, in a case,
where their own countrymen were not to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>benefitted. The present state of the funds is
not the most flourishing; and its utility is too
great to allow its falling from deficiency of
means. Would it not be advisable, to collect
a very small assessment at every house inhabited
by a native within the Maharrattah Ditch,
(which limits the jurisdiction of the police,)
either according to extent, or to its rent? This
assessment should be paid into the hands of the
magistrates, to be by them disbursed, according
to proper regulations, through the medium
of native agents, to be elected annually by all
who should contribute either a certain gross
sum, or by regular yearly donation, towards
the support of the institution. This would produce
a stabile, and adequate, revenue; while it
would likewise induce many natives, some from
pride, others from hope, and a few from fear, to
add their mites to such as should result from
that spontaneous flow of genuine humanity,
with which the Hindu code is replete; and, of
which the Hindus at large make so great a
boast. Possibly the day is not far off, when, in
lieu of building immense houses, richly endowed,
for the maintenance of an idle, haughty,
ignorant, and insolent, gang of priests, some
rich natives, reflecting on the want of their more
industrious, and more meritorious, poor, may
bequeath liberally towards the formation of such
establishments, as may rescue them from that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>variety of sufferings, to which they become subjected,
by the accumulation of years, the visitations
of disease, and the pressure of misfortune!</p>

<p class='c008'>The style of building in use among the natives,
is very different from what we should expect to
find adopted in so hot a climate; experience is,
however, in its favor, and sanctions that which,
no doubt, resulted from observation, more than
from experiment. The walls of such edifices
as are intended to be permanent, are usually
constructed of mud; which, being laid in strata,
of perhaps 18 or 20 inches in depth, each being
suffered to dry before another stratum is added
above, becomes extremely firm, and far more
durable, though not quite so neat, as unburnt
bricks laid in mud cement. The thickness of
the wall is proportioned to the intended height;
probably about 26, to 30, inches at the base,
may be considered a fair average; tapering above
to about three fourths of the breadth below. I
have seen some <em>bungalows</em> run up with mud
walls, which, after being chipped down to an
uniform thickness, and properly plastered with
fine sand, mixed with chaff, were neat enough:
but all mud walls invariably crack considerably
while drying; consequently, are apt to harbor
centipedes, scorpions, and even snakes,
within their fissures. This is a most serious
defect; completely counter-balancing the advantages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>obtained, by that facility and cheapness with
which they can be run up to a great height, provided
due attention be paid to the perpendicular.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few of the peasantry, even though possessing
some property, carry their walls higher than 8
or 10 feet; indeed, the generality of huts may
be set down at 7 feet exteriorly, though they
will rise near a cubit more inwardly, when filled
up to the under part of the thatch. It is rare to
see any window in the front; and, in such as
have enclosed areas, (by us called ‘<em>compounds,</em>’
but by the natives designated ‘<em>ungnahs</em>’,) the
<em>cricky</em>, or door, which is always very low, obliging
even short persons to stoop considerably,
is commonly in some part of the environing wall,
and partly concealed by an angle, so as to preclude
the possibility of seeing any thing of the
interior when the door is thrown open. Every
door has a frame, composed of strong wood, of
which the side pieces, or uprights, are tenoned
into mortices, made in the threshold and the
upper limb. The superincumbent part of the
edifice is supported by a strong plank, or by
several pieces of timber, laid parallel, and secured
by thorough-pins, for the whole breadth
of the wall. No arch is turned to keep off the
dead pressure of the enormous weight, that, in
many instances, is thus borne up entirely by
the door-plate. On the top of the wall, a stout
piece of timber is laid, whenever the rafters are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>fastened, each by one or more nails, but projecting
at least a foot beyond the exterior, for
the purpose of sustaining the thatch, which is
made to hang over, with the intention to throw
off the rain, that, falling in torrents during
many months, would else wash away the mud,
and endanqer the building.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thatches are usually made of the <em>kuss</em>,
or common wild grass, whose roots furnish that
fibrous substance called <em>kuss-kuss</em>, already spoken
of while describing the formation of <em>tatties</em>.
Immense plains are covered with this kind of
grass, glowing commonly about two or three
feet high: though, in some places, it may be seen
full five feet; serving as an asylum for every species
of game; causing many gentlemen, on first
entering the country, to admire, what they at first
take to be ‘the prodigious fine crops of hay.’
It is commonly burnt down every year during
the hot season, when perfectly dry: the ashes
thus tendered to the soil, being washed in by the
succeeding rains, occasion the grass to shoot
forth, from the apparent ruin, with incredible
freshness and vigor! At such times, nothing
can be more acceptable to the herds, which,
during the preceding months, are often obliged
to be sent to great distances, where a little
herbage may be found; or they are, perhaps,
subsisted upon chaff made from straw, millet-stalks,
and the refuse of the thrashing floor. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>several months, the grass in question is relished
by every description of cattle; but, after the
sun has crossed the Line, on his return to the
opposite tropic, it becomes harsh and dry, proving
so injurious to their mouths as to cause their
rejecting it, except when severely oppressed
by hunger.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the end of February, probably to the
setting in of the rains in June, great numbers of
persons are employed in cutting the <em>kuss</em>, or
<em>khur</em>, as it is indiscriminately called, with a
kind of sickle, and tying it up into <em>haunties</em>, (or
handfuls,) usually about six inches thick. These
are conveyed on <em>hackeries</em> to the several markets,
and especially to the military cantonments,
where they sell at various prices, according to
the distance they may have been conveyed, the
scarcity or abundance of the article, the time of
the year, and the pressure of the demand. From
1000 to 1200 bundles for a rupee, may be taken
as a fair medium; though, during the rains,
when thatches must often be made, or replaced,
cost what they may, I have often known them
sold at a rupee for every hundred: on the contrary,
they are often so cheap as 3000, or even
4000, for that sum. The manner of constructing
a thatch according to the best principle, both
for neatness and durability, is as follows. The
whole side of the building, intended to be covered
in, is measured, and that measurement is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>exactly represented on some level spot, by
means of four cords, fastened to as many stakes;
which thus exhibit the form and extent of the
thatch to be constructed. Each side of a quadrangular,
or other building, must be thus laid
down. All hands set to work in placing either
whole bamboos of the large kind, or bundles of
three and four of the small kind, parallel, and
about a foot asunder; all directed by the base
line, towards which they stand at right angles;
so that, when ready, they would be in the same
line with the fall of the ‘<em>chupper</em>,’ (or thatch).
These being duly prepared, are crossed at about
five, or six inches asunder, by battens of split
bamboo, which are fastened down, at every intersection,
with strong twine made of a finer
kind of grass, called the <em>moonje</em>; which is very
strong, especially when wetted. Each frame
being thus formed, is raised into its place by the
joint efforts of perhaps fifty or sixty men; some
laying hold of the frame, others pushing upwards
with forked poles of various lengths, thereby to
facilitate the ascent, and to prevent that friction
which must attend upon any continued contact
between the frame, and the several ready-laid
rafters on which it is to lie, and to which it is
to be firmly lashed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The several frames being duly fitted at the
corners, are properly secured in their places,
and to each other; after which, a slender kind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>of scaffolding is made under the eaves of the
respective frames, to enable the <em>grammies</em>, or
thatchers, to commence their operations in laying
on the coating of grass. The eaves are first
brought to the thickness of at least a foot, by
placing very large bundles, previously well compacted,
and squared at their ends, in a line between
the frame, and a succession of very strong
bamboo laths: each bundle is pressed as close
as possible to its neighbour, and thus the whole
of the lower tier is completed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rest of the thatch is laid on in small portions,
the several bundles being spread open,
and having their butts, or lower ends, compressed
between two bamboo laths, which are tied in
several places, so as to secure their contents
perfectly. Each parcel is then handed up, and
laid with the butt downwards, at about two or
three inches above its lower neighbour; causing
the whole thatch to appear in over-laps from
bottom to top, like so many ridges, of about an
inch high, and running parallel for the whole
breadth of the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The several corners are now covered with immense
trusses of refuse grass, bound very firmly
together, reaching the whole extent of the angle,
or <em>gore</em>, and full two feet in diameter. These
trusses being bound down very firmly to their
adjacent sides, are ultimately covered with layers
of <em>seerky</em>, placed so as to over-lap about a foot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>above each other, and, in their turn, duly tied
to the trusses: a similar truss is laid along the
ridge pole. This <em>seerky</em> is composed of the stems
of the <em>surput</em>, or tassel grass, which grows to
the height of ten feet, or more: it is found to
be a larger species of the celebrated Guinea
grass, formerly introduced as a supposed novelty
into the East, but which proved to be nothing
more than the common <em>bainseah</em>, or buffalo
grass, that grows wild, in the greatest luxuriance,
all over Bengal. The stems of the <em>surput</em>,
when arrived at their full size, are as thick as a
swan’s quill, and bear a remarkable gloss: in
the dry season they are cut, and, after being
stripped of the parched remains of their leaves,
are laid parallel on a board, their ends being previously
brought even to a line; a long wire
needle is then passed through the several stems,
as they lie contiguous, leading after it a piece of
packthread, which is afterwards knotted at both
ends, to prevent its withdrawing either way.
Four or five of these stitches are made in the
same parcel of <em>seerky</em>; after which, it is rolled
up breadthwise, for sale. Each parcel may be
from two feet to a yard in breadth, and the stems
composing it may be about four feet in length.
The ordinary mode of selling this commodity is
by the hundred pieces, for which from three to
ten rupees are given, according to circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>It is perhaps singular that I should have seen
<em>seerky</em> in use among a groupe of gypsies in
Essex: in India, those itinerants, whose habits
and characters correspond with this intolerable
species of banditti, invariably shelter themselves
under <em>seerky</em>; which, being remarkably light,
and, when doubled or trebled, completely water-proof,
enables them to construct a very comfortable
cabin in a few minutes. It often happens,
during the rainy season, that part of a thatch
sinks, or rots, and admits the passage of water
to the interior; in such case, a piece of <em>seerky</em>,
properly placed, causes the water to flow over
the defect: when that article cannot be had, it
is found expedient to throw a few pecks of
chaff, or straw cut very small, upon those parts
requiring relief; the chaff is drawn in by the
percolating fluid, but, being obstructed in its
passage, swells in consequence of the continued
moisture, and thus, in a short time, usually
stops the leaks. The mode of putting on a thatch
above described, is confined to certain parts of
the country; in other places, they put the grass
on in a reversed position, as we do our wheat
stubble thatches, the part which grew uppermost
being placed lowest. But throughout the
country, all thatching is done horizontally, and
not vertically, as among us: the Indian thatcher
begins at the bottom; whereas we commence at
the side of a thatch: we thatch with skewers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>and rods of hazel, &amp;c.; they with bamboo laths
and twine made of grass; the latter being passed
to and fro by means of long needles, made extemporaneously
of bamboo, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doors used by the natives are generally
made of such wood as the neighbouring country
may afford, and consist of a few vertical planks,
kept together by two, or more, horizontal battens;
the fastenings are, for the most part,
made by staples and hooks, into which strong
wooden bars slip, and unslip, with ease. The
windows are always very small, perhaps not
more than two feet square, and are closed
by means of wooden shutters, having exteriorly
a <em>jaump</em>, made of bamboo battens and mats;
which, being firmly put together, and suspended
at their upper borders by hooks, or rings, fastened
into the wall, or into the wooden plate
covering the aperture, may be raised, as though
on hinges, to any desired elevation, and preserved
therein, by bamboo stilts, made either
with forked ends, or having small blocks of
wood nailed to them, to prevent their points
from passing through the mats. The same
kind of defence is used for doors in general, but
of a much larger size than for windows; when
raised, they certainly are extremely useful in
keeping off the sun and rain; when lowered, so
as to lie parallel with, and close to, the wall,
they are an admirable defence against wind and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>dust; though both will find their way through
the several small apertures in sufficient quantity
to prove highly unpleasant at certain times. In
houses constructed by the natives, the windows
are placed very high up; sometimes scarcely
allowing a person to look out. This is done for
the sake both of privacy, and of coolness; as
the rarefied air is better enabled to make its
escape, than when the apertures are low. Thus,
most of the houses built by the French at Chandernagore,
&amp;c. are far cooler than those formerly
built in Calcutta; owing to the windows of the
former being carried nearly to the tops of the
rooms, while the latter have often seven or eight
feet of wall above them. It has several times
happened, that persons sent up to work at the
timbers supporting the flat roof above, have
fallen from their ladders, or scaffolds, in consequence
of the air in the upper part of the
room being unfit for respiration. As to chimnies,
they are utterly unknown among the
natives: though, in some cottages, an aperture
is left for the escape of smoke, but rather by
neglect than by design. The smoke must escape
when and how it can; but, it does not incommode
a native a thousandth part so much as it
does an European, who must suffer some inconvenience
at the best of times, when a fire
is lighted within the sitting room; but, when
green wood is put on, the latter cannot stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>its effects. The former will, even at such moments,
often be seen smoking his <em>goorgoory</em>, as
though the atmosphere were not sufficiently
burthened with fuliginous particles to amuse his
lungs. Victuals are rarely cooked within the
house, when the weather permits of that operation
being performed in the open air; indeed,
few persons, who are not extremely poor, are
without some little shed, under which it may be
carried on at all times.</p>

<p class='c008'>The exterior surface of the wall is rarely
plastered, even with mud; it being an object to
preserve it rough, in order that the large cakes
of cow-dung, intended for fuel, may be stuck
up against them, and there be thoroughly dried
by the sun; which is generally effected, in
exposed situations, and in fair weather, in one,
or two, days, at the utmost. These cakes,
called <em>gutties</em>, burn admirably well; making a
fire not unlike that resulting from good peat.
The interior is usually smoothed all the way up,
or at least for about three feet from the floor,
and smeared with a solution of cow-dung, as is
the floor itself, which is rarely made of any
thing but clay, well rammed down, or perhaps
of tarras; but, the latter is too costly for most
individuals, and, though indicating riches, does
not give so much satisfaction to the proprietor.
In some houses, a few joists of rough wood
are thrown across from the top of one, to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>of the other, wall; perhaps at a yard or more
asunder: some few instances may be adduced,
perhaps, in each village of note, of a slight
kind of flooring, either of rough planks, not
fitted together, or of bamboo laths, being made
above the joists, for the accommodation of luggage,
or for the dormitory of some of the family;
but, with such exceptions, the only use made of
the upper part is for the lodgement of brush-wood,
bamboo poles, ladders, farming utensils,
mats, nets, &amp;c. &amp;c., according to the occupant’s
profession.</p>

<p class='c008'>The private apartments are commonly separate
from what we should call the ‘keeping room,’
and have a separate entrance, if under the same
roof; it is, however, very common to allot some
detached building, having a <em>compound</em> divided
off, and perfectly sequestered from the other
accommodations, set apart for the <em>zenanah</em>, or
female part of the family. The horses, oxen,
cows, &amp;c., are commonly picketted out in the
open air when the weather permits; having a
large trough of mud to receive their chaff.
During great heats, or heavy rains, they are
sheltered under sheds made for that purpose,
and for the preservation of the <em>palanquin</em>, <em>dooly</em>,
<em>r’hut</em>, or other vehicle the occupant may possess.
Sometimes the kine are kept under the same
roof with the major-domo, and all his family.
Candles are not used in the houses of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>natives, especially of the Hindus, who would
consider the presence of a lump of tallow within
their areas, as sufficient to pollute whatever they
might contain. All use oil, which, being poured
into a small earthen vessel, nearly in the shape
of a heart, or of a <em>peepul</em> leaf, called a <em>churraug</em>,
is placed in one of the numerous niches made
in every wall, at perhaps four feet above the
floor: the wicks are chiefly made of slips of
rag, about a foot long, rolled up to the thickness
of a goose-quill. For more immediate use, the
<em>churraug</em> is often placed on a stem of wood,
having a broad base, or a cross, to support it,
and a small block at its summit, hollowed out
to receive the bottom of the lamp. Some use
brass apparatus, and, in a very few instances,
the stems, or pillars, are made with a slide, so
as to vary the height of the <em>churraug</em>; which, in
such case, assumes the more dignified appellation
of <em>pilsoze</em>: the ordinary height of the lamp
from the floor, including the plinth, pillar, and
capital, may be from twenty to twenty-six
inches. Snuffers are unknown; their place is
sometimes supplied by the fingers, but more
generally by a pair of scissors, or a pair of <em>duspannahs</em>,
(<i>i.e.</i> tongs,) such as are used by <em>hookah-burdars</em>.
The oil in use for lamps is that already
spoken of, extracted from the <em>sesamum</em>, of which
the refuse cake is given to favorite oxen, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although <em>charpoys</em>, or small beds, are in use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>among all classes, the generality prefer sleeping
on mats, which are infinitely cooler than any
beddings. The whole of the apparatus for a
dormitory may be comprised in a very short
catalogue; namely, a <em>durmah-mat</em>, made from
coarse reeds split open and laid flat, with the
glossy surface uppermost; perhaps a <em>satrinje</em>, or
small cotton carpet, a <em>chudder</em>, or sheet, to
wrap round the body, and a <em>tuckeah</em>, or pillow,
stuffed very hard. In cold weather, a <em>goodry</em>,
or quilt; perhaps, indeed, two, may be added.
Curtains are out of the question, as are all those
paraphernalia which luxury has introduced among
us. A <em>peek-daun</em>, or spitting pot, made generally
of <em>phool</em>, which is a very tolerable kind of tutenagne,
is always placed at the bed side, and is
ever resorted to when chewing the <em>pawn</em>, or
beetle. The vine bearing the aromatic leaf so
called, is most carefully cultivated in many
parts of the country; the whole being supported
on trellisses made of reeds, and small bamboos,
to the height of about five feet. The situation
must be very dry; hence, the banks of old tanks,
and other such elevated sites, are chosen for
cultivating the <em>pawn</em>, of which it is said a <em>bigah</em>
will produce, in the vicinity of any populous
city, full two hundred rupees yearly; provided
the vines be of the <em>sunҫhah</em>, or true sort; which
is easily known by the yellowness of the borders,
and ramifications, of the leaf. This species is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>far more pleasant to the palate than the common
green kind; which is, besides, tough, and possesses
a certain acrid quality.</p>

<p class='c008'><em>Beetle</em>, or <em>pawn</em>, is prepared by carefully picking
out any defects in the leaves, and by removing
the stalks up to their very centres; four
or five leaves are then laid one above the
other, when the upper one is smeared with
shell-lime, a little moistened with water. The
seeds of the <em>elatchee</em>, or cardamom, are added,
together with about the fourth part of a <em>beetle-nut</em>,
(that is, of the <em>areca</em>,) and, the whole being
lapped up by folding the leaves over their
contents, the little packet is kept together in
its due form, which is usually triangular, by
means of a slice of <em>beetle-nut</em>, cut into a thin
wedge, so as to transfix it completely. It is
common to see a whole family partaking of
<em>pawns</em>, the chewing of which occasions the
saliva to be tinctured as red as blood: they certainly
are fragrant, and excellent stomachics;
but their too frequent use produces costiveness,
which, in that climate, ever induces serious
illness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The saliva will not be tinctured, if the <em>chunam</em>,
(<i>i.e.</i> the lime,) be omitted; hence, it is
evident that the alkali produces the color from
the juices contained in the <em>pawn</em>. The color thus
obtained does not stain linen. Some use the <em>k’hut</em>,
which is the same as our <em>Terra Japonica</em>, and is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>procured by bleeding various kinds of trees, principally
the mimosa, abounding in most of the
<em>jungles</em> (or wildernesses): a small quantity, about
the size of a pea, broken into several pieces, is
mixed with the other ingredients, before the
leaves are lapped over, and transfixed with the
spike of beetle, or, perhaps, with a clove. The
<em>k’hut</em> is not, in my opinion, any thing in favor
of the <em>pawn</em>, and certainly adds to that noxious
quality above mentioned. Some persons attribute
the blackness of the teeth, in both males
and females, throughout India, to the use of
<em>pawn</em>; under the opinion, that the discoloration
is effected by the lime blended therein.
Such is, however, wide of the fact: <em>pawn</em> is
found to be highly favorable to the gums,
when the lime is omitted; and so sensible are
those who chew it of the bad effects produced
by the alkali upon the enamel of the teeth, that,
in order to preserve them from corrosion, they
rub them frequently with the preparation called
<em>missy</em>; thereby coating them with that black
substance which does not readily give way,
even to the most powerful dentifrice. I strongly
suspect, however, that, in thus shielding the
teeth from the alkali, some injury is done to
the enamel by the supposed preservative;
though by no means to that extent the former
would speedily effect, but for the use of <em>missy</em>.
The natives only chew the <em>pawn</em>, rejecting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>masticated ingredients when their flavor has
been extracted; some reject even the saliva
tinctured by the <em>pawn</em>, spitting it out into the
<em>peek-daun</em>. A few, not content with the compound
already described, absolutely mix tobacco,
previously reduced to a coarse powder,
by rubbing the dried leaves with the thumb in
the hollow of the other hand! One would think
that ‘potent weed’ must supersede all its companions,
and cause them to be as little tasted,
as though they had not been crowded into the
jumble of flavors.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have already explained, that earthen pipes,
such as those we call ‘Dutch pipes’, are not
known in India; but that the <em>hookah</em>, <em>kaleaun</em>,
and <em>goorgoory</em>, are in general use, among the
several classes respectively. The lowest classes
of Europeans, as also of the natives, and, indeed,
most of the officers of country-ships,
frequently smoke <em>cheroots</em>, exactly corresponding
with the Spanish <em>segar</em>, though usually made
rather more bulky. However fragrant the
smokers themselves may consider <em>cheroots</em>, those
who use <em>hookahs</em>, hold them to be not only
vulgar, but intolerable! Hence, we sometimes
see a whole congregation of the latter put to
the route by some one unlucky visitor, who,
either from ignorance, of from disregard to the
feelings of his more delicate participators in
‘the cloudy regale’, mounts his <em>cheroot</em>; thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>abrogating all distinctions of musk, cinnamon,
rose-water, &amp;c. in a trice.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives smoke <em>cheroots</em> without any precaution
whatever to guard the lips and teeth
from the highly acidulated fumes derived from
the burning tobacco, but when, as has sometimes
been the case, <em>cheroots</em> were brought into
fashion, though but for a while, it was found
expedient to have small silver or earthen sockets
made, to receive the end of the <em>cheroot</em>; thereby
avoiding contact with the tobacco.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives, whether male or female, never
use any sort of dentifrice, nor have they any
idea of hair-brushes; which could not, indeed,
according to their tenets, be admitted within
the mouth. The only apparatus employed for
cleaning the teeth, is a short piece of stick,
commonly the branch of some bush, pulled at
the moment for the occasion: this is either
beat or chewed, for a short time, until the
fibres, for about half an inch at the end, separate,
and form a kind of stiff brush, which
is applied at right angles to the teeth. This
is not a very delicate implement, but, when
aided by a plentiful supply of water, answers
tolerably well; though it certainly can never
prevent the accumulation of tartar within the
teeth. Necessity has made me sometimes use
the <em>dauntwun</em>, as it is called, but not without
leaving considerable soreness about my gums.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>The ladies of Hindostan smoke their <em>goorgoories</em>
in very high stile; as do those of inferior
rank their <em>nereauls</em>, or cocoa-nuts, with no
less glee. It would, perhaps, be difficult to decide
which of the sexes were most addicted
to this habit: they both begin at a very early
age, and are never so happy as when engaged
in its practice. After a while, we become reconciled
to seeing females smoking; though I
must confess, that, however delicate the preparation
of the tobacco may be, and however
elegant the apparatus, still a certain idea, not
very conformable to feminine propriety, creeps
into our minds, when we see an European lady
thus employed. We revolt at a habit not authorized
by what we have been accustomed to
in our early youth, and consider it an intrusion
upon masculine characteristics. Several
ladies have gone yet further, by adopting the
entire costume of the natives; a circumstance
which, however gratifying it may have been to
themselves, by no means raised them in the
estimation of those whom they imitated; while,
at the same time, it gave birth to opinions, and
occasionally to <em>experiments</em>, by no means favorable
to their reputation. The same kind of
ridicule attaches equally to gentlemen, who at
times allow their whiskers to grow, and who
wear turbans, &amp;c., in imitation of the Mussulmans
of distinction. Their countrymen, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>perhaps tacitly, censure such imitations, when
arising from caprice; and the Mussulmans regard
these renegadoes in costume much the same
as we do such of the natives, as, being smitten
with our general character, and partaking of our
pastimes, lay aside their appropriate garments
in favor of jackets, jockey-caps, boots, and
leather inexpressibles! Some, indeed, do more;
they sit at table, and devour, with no small
degree of eagerness, the viands prepared according
to English fashion; washing them down
with copious libations of Claret and Madeira, to
the utter degradation of their persons, and reputation,
in the eyes both of their new, and of
their old, companions.</p>

<p class='c008'>But there is a certain happiness apparently
attendant upon this species of infatuation; what
is lost in public opinion being invariably gained
in self-sufficiency; while every little ironical
compliment is construed into superlative eulogium.
The present Nabob Vizier of Oude,
<em>Saadut Ali</em>, many years ago, when compelled
to reside at the Presidency, under serveillance
of the Bengal government, in consequence of
the jealousy entertained by his brother, the late
<em>Asoph ul Dowlah</em>, affected to enter upon this kind
of apostacy. I believe, every one saw through
the veil, though he hunted with fox-hounds
in our style, and assimilated in many other
points; but the essentials were carefully preserved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>from metamorphosis. Many characters,
such as I have described, could be quoted, but
the most particularly appropriate to my subject
is that of <em>Mirza Abu Taleb Khan</em>, who embarked
in the same ship with me, for the
purpose of proceeding from Bengal to England,
where he was at first received as a general
and prince; merely owing to an empty title
conferred on him at the Nabob Vizier’s court,
about as important as that of a Windsor Knight.
This hero did not, it is true, adopt our costume
altogether, though he became a kind of
‘half and half, like the sea-calf at Sir Ashton’s;’
but he had the impudence to assert, that
his paltry lodgings in <em>Gresse-Street</em>, (above all
places under the sun,) were graced by the nocturnal
visits of several Peeresses of the most
exalted character; many of whose names he
most scandalously, and ungratefully, disclosed!
I say, ungratefully, because it was impossible for
me to believe that ladies of such character could
have stooped to such conduct; although, in
consequence of suitable introductions, they had
received him at their houses in that hospitable
manner ever adopted in favor of respectable foreigners.
The <em>Mirza</em>, very probably, may have
been imposed upon by some low women, who
made him the Falstaff of their drama; and, by
assuming the titles of our nobility, flattered his
vanity to an extreme! Yet, supposing this to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>have been the fact, how are we to find an apology
for that open boast he made of the supposed
intimacy! But vanity was his motto; he studied
singularity in many instances; he studied
also celebrity; and would willingly have impressed
us with an opinion, that, from <em>Hafiz</em> down to
the <em>Plenipo’</em>, his abilities were triumphant. Let
us compare him with the former, whose poetry
charmed his countrymen!</p>

<p class='c029'>Without upholding this little production as a
prodigy, it may, perhaps, be safely adduced as
a contrast to those beauties I have selected from
the <em>Mirza’s</em> little book of great wonders.</p>

<p class='c029'>The frequency of fires, occasioned by the
common practice of thatching houses, has caused
many regulations to be adopted, in regard to
what Europeans commonly call the ‘Black
Town’ at Calcutta. About twenty years ago,
the principal streets were considerably widened,
and the whole of the new tenements were ordered
to be tiled. This created some dissatisfaction
at the time, yet has not only been of great
advantage to the inhabitants at large, but is now
confessed, by the natives, to have been highly
beneficial, both to their health, and to their
convenience. Formerly, it was common to see
immense piles of grass all along the banks of
the river, brought thither for the purpose of supplying
persons who might have occasion to
thatch; of late years, however, the quantity
has been considerably reduced; there being not
a twentieth part of the former demand. Many
of these stacks doubtless contained full 20,000,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>or 25,000 cubic feet, and would have formed a
diminutive representation of the infernal regions,
had they taken fire; to which accident they
were subject equally with any part of the town.
Owing to the cheapness of bamboos and mats,
as well as to the immense value of land at Calcutta,
most of the natives build their huts chiefly
of those materials; the whole of the uprights,
rafters, &amp;c., being of bamboo, and the walls,
partitions, &amp;c., being of mats, supported by
bamboo laths. The roofs are first covered with
mats, or <em>seerky</em>, and then tiled, generally with
that kind called <em>nullies</em>, which are about eight
inches in length, representing the half of a truncated
hollow cone, whose base may be about
four inches in diameter.</p>

<p class='c008'>These <em>nullies</em> are commonly laid upon roofs,
at an angle of about 30° of elevation from the
horizon; but the <em>chuppers</em>, or grass-thatches,
usually are constructed at full 40°. At the
military stations, where grass is invariably in
use for the covering in of the cabins of the
sepoys, &amp;c. it is usual to order the surfaces of
all thatches to be smeared with mud; from
about November, to the setting in of the rains.
Many very extensive lines owe their safety to
this precaution; whereby not only are sparks
prevented from communicating with the grass,
which usually is as prompt as tinder in taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>fire, but even when the thatch is partially
kindled, the flames are greatly impeded, and
more easily subdued.</p>

<p class='c008'>The walls of huts being very frequently made
of grass, tied in between bamboo laths; (like
those fences we sometimes see put to folds in
yeaning time, to keep the lambs warm during
the night;) require to be well coated with mud:
otherwise, they would be constantly subject to
accension, in consequence of the too common
practice of making the <em>choolah</em>, or fire-place,
very near thereto; thus endangering both from
the flame, and from the embers. As to putting
out a fire that has once got firm hold of a plain
thatch, it is a hopeless business: the only chance
of saving the street, is to pull down all
the neighbouring huts. This is not attended
with that loss to which our European towns
would be subjected by such a preventive; since,
generally speaking, a very tolerable hut, fit for
the accommodation of a moderate family, may
be built, complete, for about the value of a
guinea, or even much less.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although water is generally at hand, there
being abundance of wells, or tanks, or puddles,
in the vicinity of every village, still it is deemed
necessary, by gentlemen whose <em>bungalows</em>, &amp;c.,
are contiguous to <em>bazars</em>, (or markets,) or to
the lines of native troops, &amp;c. where thatches
are numerous, to have large vessels fastened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>along the ridge-poles of their stables, and other
out-offices. These being constantly kept full
of water, prove an immense aid towards the
preservation of those buildings on which they
are placed: since, in case of any neighbouring
conflagration, it is easy for one or more persons
to wet the thatch very thoroughly; or they
may reserve the water until the moment of exigency,
to be thrown upon any part that may be
in immediate danger. If the thatch should have
taken fire, so as to render it imprudent for persons
to ascend to the pots, they, being rather
brittle, may always be broken to pieces by
throwing bricks, or clods, &amp;c. at them. Some
gentlemen adopt the precaution, above described,
of plastering the thatches of their out-offices
with mud; but, such a procedure is highly
impolitic, in respect to edifices intended to be
durable; as the white-ants never fail to visit
such plastered thatches, and to destroy the grass
entirely: sometimes they even eat the timbers.
Tiles certainly offer greater security than
thatches, but they are insufferably hot; causing
every thing placed under them to warp, crack,
and otherwise to perish: tiled stables are found
to be very injurious to the health of cattle. The
best plan I ever saw, was to have a coating of
tiles, laid in mortar on a thatch; but, for such
a mode of construction, very substantial timbers
were requisite. This not only insured from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>fire, but from leaks also; and rendered the interior
remarkably cool during the hot season.</p>

<p class='c008'>The long continuance of the periodical rains,
which often fall in torrents for whole days, and
frequently keep drizzling for near a week, with
little or no intermission, renders it necessary to
protect all exterior walls by copings, either of
tiles, or of thatch. The former mode is effected
by small tiles, laid in the usual manner, but
cemented with lime mortar; or by immense large
ones, nearly semi-cylindrical, whose curve may
measure full a yard, and whose breadth may be
from fifteen to twenty inches; the thickness,
perhaps, an inch and a half. These last are
merely slung over the top of the wall, which is
formed so as to retain them firmly, and are overlapped
about two or three inches. The thatches
are generally made with a double pent, each
face being about a yard in depth: they are
secured by being fastened together at their junction
above, and by means of stakes passing
through the wall; to these their eaves are tied
with grass, or coarse hempen twine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing can be more uncomfortable than a
leaky <em>bungalow</em>! The water trickles down the
walls, dissolving the coat of mud, or sand plaster,
and greatly disfiguring the interior. It often
happens, that the outer walls are so far damaged
by heavy rains, accompanied by a driving wind,
as to be rendered unserviceable in the course of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>a night; the whole being completely sapped
through. After such weather, the damages are
frequently extensive; the walls surrounding
gardens, &amp;c. though substantially built, and
duly coped, are seen to give way for scores of
yards; falling with a tremendous crash. This
is usually occasioned by some ditch near their
bases, which, being filled by the heavy rains,
that soak into the banks, in a few hours yield
to the great weight on their borders. Fortunately,
such damages are speedily repaired at no very
great expence; a rod of wall about eight feet
high, and averaging two feet in thickness, being
generally built for about ten shillings: in some
places for half that sum.</p>

<p class='c008'>Most of the <em>bungalows</em> built by Europeans are
run up with sun-dried bricks; usually of a large
size, eight of them making a cubic foot; each
being a foot long, six inches broad, and three
inches thick. With these, in a proper state for
building, work proceeds at a great rate, but
much care must be taken that the mortar, that
is, the slime used for cement, be of a proper
consistence, and be well filled in. Bricks are
generally made in wooden moulds, which, being
laid on some level spot, previously swept, so as
to remove stones, &amp;c., are filled with mud; the
surface is then levelled, either with the hand,
or with a strike, when the mould is raised, by
means of handles, and washed in a large pan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>water, and then placed on a fresh spot, contiguous
to the brick already formed. An expert
laborer in this avocation, will, if duly supplied
with mud, and water, make from 2000 to 2500
bricks daily of the above dimensions: it will
usually require one laborer to mix the soil, one
to supply water, and two hand-barrow men, to
keep one brick-maker in constant work: the
whole expence may be about sixteen or eighteen
pence: the same quantity of work done in
England would cost full as many shillings.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the <em>rauz</em>, or bricklayers, in India,
are very clever, so far as relates to mere practical
operations; but they have not the smallest
idea of planning from paper, or on paper; or of
computing the quantities of materials, or the
amount of labor. They work with a small
trowel, much the same as that in use with us,
and chip their bricks, whether sun-dried or
burnt, with a small hammer, having either one,
or both, its face, of a wedge form, and about
three or four inches long from the insertion of
the handle. They preserve the perpendiculars
by means of a bell-shaped weight, commonly of
free-stone, or of lead, or iron, to which a long
cotton cord is attached, having on it a piece of
wood exactly as long as the diameter of the
weight’s base. This being pierced in the centre,
and applied endwise to any part, preserving
it, at the same time, as nearly horizontal as possible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>points out the exact spot which is perpendicular
to the corresponding edge of the weight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Supposing a wall to be run up to any height,
if the stick be applied to the upper tier of
bricks, and the weight swings so as just to come
in contact with the ground tier, the wall will be
perpendicular. The method is simple, and the
apparatus portable; therefore I may safely recommend
their adoption to our workmen; especially
when a large plumb-bevil is not at hand.
It is true, that many of the bricklayers, employed
under regular architects, may be seen to
use our tools of every description; but this
takes place only under such guidance: in all
other instances, the native bricklayer resorts to
the practices of his ancestors; though, to say
the truth, they are by no means so unwilling to
change for better, as the opinionated British
mechanic; who, I am obliged to confess, must
yield the palm for sobriety, cheapness, ingenuity,
and docility, to the unlettered artisan of
the East. Nevertheless, I am sensible that one
English workman will ‘knock off’ more work
than two, or perhaps three, Asiatics of the same
profession, and finish that work in higher style;
but, if we take into consideration, that the
latter employs tools such as the former would
pronounce to be useless, and, that he learns all
by rote, without the smallest idea of figures, proportions,
or computations, we must, however
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>unwillingly, give a verdict by no means partial
to our countrymen.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another point greatly in favor of the poor
Hindu, is, that he exercises not only the profession
of bricklayer, but of plasterer, tarras-maker,
&amp;c. In like manner, we find the two professions of
<em>looaur</em> (blacksmith) and <em>burrye</em> (carpenter) often
exercised by the same individual. I once built
a phaeton at Cawnpore, solely with the aid of a
<em>reputed</em> blacksmith, who wrought every part of
the iron work in a very superior manner, and
constructed the whole of the wood-work in an
excellent style. Nay, he made the head, and
lined it with woollen very neatly; and, after all,
lent a hand towards the painting. His wages
were only eight rupees (twenty shillings) monthly,
and he never had been concerned in constructing
any kind of vehicle, except the <em>hackery</em> in common
use; which has already been described.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives are extremely negligent regarding
the strength of their floors; they seem to be
fully satisfied when the places where they lie
down on their mats are tolerably dry; though
it is by no means uncommon to see the whole
interior so extremely damp, that, if any seeds,
such as wheat, peas, rice, &amp;c., happen to fall,
and to be swept to the skirts of the apartments,
such are sure to vegetate; frequently exhibiting
a very promising blade, before they fall,
rather in consequence of accident, than of design
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>on the part of the tenants. Whatever the
flooring may consist of, whether clay, or tarras,
that of the eating apartment is, almost invariably,
smeared with a solution of cow-dung;
which certainly gives a freshness, and may probably
tend to salubrity; nor is it so devoid of
neatness as an European would imagine; but
the scent is by no means agreeable. Some ornament
both the interior, and the exterior, of
their houses, by dipping the palms of their
hands, horizontally, into solutions of ochre,
chiefly red, and then imprinting the walls with
their hands thus colored. These prints are put
on irregularly, by no means proving the taste
of the operators, who, nevertheless, consider
their huts to be, (in the language of church-wardens,)
‘beautified;’ the great consideration
is, however, to typify the infinite power of the
Creator, whose hands are supposed to be innumerable,
and perpetually in action. Even
horses, especially if white or dun colored, are
very frequently marked in the same manner,
by means of <em>mindy</em>, (or <em>hinnah</em>;) which, being
reduced to a pulp, is applied to the part in such
form as it may be intended to appear. This
plaster, for I know not what else to call it, is
allowed to remain until perfectly dry; when it
commonly cracks and falls off, leaving a rich
<em>barré</em> color; though, if not allowed, either by
the animal’s restlessness, or from want of time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>to impart its coloring matter duly, the stain
will shew much fainter; perhaps not unlike a
light mahogany color.</p>

<p class='c008'>The natives rarely omit to tinge about ten
inches, or a foot, of the extremity of the tail
of every light-colored horse with <em>mindy</em>: sometimes,
also, at about two inches asunder, one
or two rings are stained in the same manner.
Nor is this herb restricted solely to the
ornamenting, or, rather, the disguising of horses,
oxen &amp;c.; the Hindostanee ladies generally
stain the whole of the interior of their hands,
including the fingers, as well as the soles of
their feet, with <em>mindy</em>; the tips of all the nails
are sure to undergo the operation; which often
compels the party sustaining this gratifying penance,
to sit motionless for hours; in order that
the dye may take a firm hold of the skin. When
properly managed, the stain will remain for at
least a month; resisting every endeavor to wash
it out, and seeming only to yield to the constant
growth of the outer skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has often occurred to me, that, possibly, an
excellent dye for woollens might be obtained
from the <em>hinnah</em>, which, being inspissated, or
reduced to an extract, could be imported
among our dyers with peculiar advantage. The
plant, which is not unlike myrtle, is indigenous
throughout Hindostan, where it is principally
employed in making garden hedges, much the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>same as yew, box, &amp;c., are among us; but,
owing to its not proving a defence against
cattle, and being of slow growth, the exterior
hedges, in lieu of being formed of <em>hinnah</em>, are
usually made of <em>baubool</em>, a species of <em>mimosa</em>,
yielding some gum, and otherwise extremely
serviceable; both from the excellence of its
wood, for all circular or angular work, requiring
great strength, durability, and toughness; and
for its bark, which is at least equal to that of
the oak for tanning. The natives consider the
application of <em>mindy</em> to be attended with good
effects; they say it is cooling, but I should
rather apprehend it were the reverse, it being
certainly an astringent, and contributing to check
perspiration: hence, the hands of such as apply
it commonly have a harsh, dry feel. That it
may be a corrective of that scent sometimes attendant
upon an habitual discharge from the feet,
may be true; but, it remains still to be questioned,
whether the obstruction of such a discharge
can be reconciled to prudence: it is, however,
a complaint very rarely to be met with in India;
doubtless owing to frequent washing, and to
that abundant and general perspiration which
shews itself very conspicuously.</p>

<p class='c008'>An extended quotation on the private lives of women, beginning on
p. <a href='#Page_347'>347</a>, is continued with each paragraph with an opening single
quotation mark, which convention ends ambiguously, without comment,
on p. <a href='#Page_408'>408</a>. The succeeding paragraph begins a section on kite flying.
This is the only portion of the book to employ footnotes, save
for those used to annotate a poem beginning on p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those footnotes are moved to follow the paragraph within which they are
references, and a sequenced numerically for uniqueness. Notes <a href='#f3'>3</a> and <a href='#f7'>7</a>
are referenced twice each in the text. The three notes on the poem
beginning on p. <a href='#Page_504'>504</a> are lettered A, B, and C.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping in mind the vintage of the text, spelling has generally been
followed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a discussion of language learning, on p. <a href='#Page_178'>178</a>, the phrase
“he added five words each month” seems an error, but it is impossible
to determine what the author must have meant.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hyphenation of compound words can be variable. Where it occurs on a line
break, the most commonly used form is assumed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
